However, this communication can be dishonest, and when people attempt to judge dishonesty, irrespective of the cues available, they tend to rely on a few nonverbal cues that are not the most reliable. Literature review: According to leakage theory, CMC modes differ from each other in the number of cues to deception they can transmit, potentially affecting one's ability to detect deception in a given medium. There is considerable research on peoples' use of nonverbal cues across CMC modes to evaluate deception, but limited understanding of the choices they make and the extent to which their deception judgments are impaired or helped by cues they have access to for different CMC modes. Research questions: 1. To what extent are the nonverbal cues that people say they rely on to detect deception shaped by the medium that they use for communication? 2. What are the effects of nonverbal cue availability on deception detection success? Methodology: We conducted an experiment with 132 veracity judges from New Zealand and Jamaica, who observed interview segments in Spanish and Hindi (languages that they did not understand) to isolate the effects of nonverbal cues. They determined the veracity of each segment and listed the things that guided their judgment. Results/discussion: The results suggest that when certain nonverbal cues are available, such as gaze aversion, these suppress attention to more reliable cues (e.g., voice pitch) when judging deception. Redirecting attention to more reliable cues is therefore important. Unexpectedly, cue choice also varied across language by medium. Conclusions: The findings extend the understanding of people's use of nonverbal cues and the extent to which certain cues distract in the deception judgment. Although people rely on vocalic cues in audio-only media and kinesic cues in video-only media, they tend to rely mostly on, and are distracted by, a few kinesic cues for full audiovisual media, even though vocalic cues are available. We also found that people can successfully detect cues to deception, even when their communication mode is relatively bereft of useful information. However, the availability (or lack) of nonverbal cues was not a factor in deception detection success. To improve detection, deception training that targets reliable cues for different media is needed.",Computer-mediated communication (CMC) | deception detection | nonverbal cues | verbal cues,0,0,,,,undefined,,8890996200,Gabriel Giordano,Gabriel,Giordano,Tenure,Professor,Analytics and Information Systems Faculty,,8890996200,,,,,,2022-2023

Yet it is challenging. While deceptive communication has been studied for decades, some areas are not well understood. In particular, two areas that could benefit from further research concern the effects of cultural differences and communication media on deception and its detection. Building on developments in theories of deception and its detection, we examine the question: How do differences in culture between senders and receivers affect deception detection, especially where the deceptive communication occurs across different media? To address this question, stimulus materials from recorded interviews were created featuring participants from the United States, Spain, and India. Three stimulus sets were created, one each in American English, Spanish, and Indian English, and each consisting of 32 interview snippets. Half of the snippets were honest and half were dishonest. Each snippet represented one of four media: full audio-visual, video only, audio only, and text only. Veracity judges were also recruited from the same three countries as the interview participants, to independently observe and evaluate the communication both within their culture and across other cultures.

Does this conclusion also hold for computer-mediated communication and deception detection? Using Prominence-Interpretation Theory (PIT; Fogg, 2003) and Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT; Buller & Burgoon, 1996), we investigated the relationships among media, credibility and its antecedents, and deception detection. We expanded PIT using key concepts from IDT, resulting in what we call expanded PIT (EPIT). We created a model of EPIT and derived seven propositions from it.

We conducted an experiment involving 74 pairs of undergraduate students. We found that the perceived credibility of the sender significantly affected both detection success and false alarms, such that the less credible the sender, the better the detection and the more false alarms generated. We also found significant relationships between three of the four antecedents and credibility: participants who were trained to detect cues to deception, who were motivated to find deception, and who communicated via e-mail were more likely to perceive senders as not credible, compared to participants who were not trained, not motivated, and who communicated via VOIP.

However, because communication characteristics are different in virtual team settings, especially when they are text based, communication problems, such as deception, arise. Recent research found that deceptive individuals in virtual teams can have a negative impact on group task performance, and it recognized that in addition to the communication medium, task and group characteristics, such as task complexity and group member experience, are important influences in these settings. However, the impacts of these additional influences have not been empirically examined. Research question: Does group members' experience with each other and task complexity affect their deception detection accuracy and task performance in a computer-mediated communication setting? Literature review: Previous literature has shown that deceivers are an important influence on computer-mediated groups. However, few studies have compared different group settings, and no studies have empirically tested the impact that task and group characteristics, such as task complexity and group member experience, have on these types of groups. Methodology: An experiment was designed to test the effect of group member experience and task complexity on computer-mediated groups facing deception. Two-hundred fifty-six undergraduates (256) were selected for the experiment. Results and conclusions: Quantitative analysis, which included multivariate analysis of variance, revealed that (a) groups performing a low-complexity task were better at detecting deception than were groups performing a high-complexity task, (b) groups with members who had experience with each other had higher task performance than did inexperienced groups, and (c) experienced groups did not have higher accuracy in detecting deception than did inexperienced groups. These results highlight the importance of understanding the different affects that task complexity and group member experience have on virtual teams facing deception, and they provide insight into what practices can help minimize the impact of interactive computer-mediated deception. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Deception detection | group member experience | instant messaging | media synchronicity | task complexity,10,0,,,,undefined,,8890996200,Gabriel Giordano,Gabriel,Giordano,Tenure,Professor,Analytics and Information Systems Faculty,,8890996200,,,,,,2012-2013

One key area affected by computer mediated communication in group settings is the transmission of cues to deception. If cues to deception are filtered, such as they are with computer-mediated communication, deception detection accuracy can be hindered due to the lack of cues available, and group task performance can be lowered. Past deception research was not very applicable to many business settings since the tasks studied did not mimic the interactive, computer-mediated group settings where business decisions are often made. Past research also did not look at the influences of individuals' familiarity with each other and their task complexity, which are key parts of group decision-making processes. We plan to conduct two experiments that simulate organizational collaborative group settings by having groups of subjects perform a computer-mediated collaborative task. Our experimental task will be a computerized strategy game where groups of subjects will methodically search a game board for a fixed number of targets, which they will attempt to destroy on their final turn. We will manipulate subjects' task complexity and group members' familiarity with each other in the experiments. We will then look at how their task performance and deception detection accuracy are influenced by these factors when they are facing a deceptive group member.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,8890996200,Gabriel Giordano,Gabriel,Giordano,Tenure,Professor,Analytics and Information Systems Faculty,,8890996200,,,,,,2005-2006

Globalization has lead to a dispersion of general knowledge, clusters of specific knowledge, and numerous cultural differences in organizations. Organizations that implement effective knowledge management systems have the ability to leverage knowledge-based assets that can lead to increased organizational performance. Cultural differences are central to knowledge management because an organization’s culture shapes the assumptions about what knowledge is, what knowledge is worth managing, and how knowledge is created, legitimized, and distributed. However, much of the conceptualization of knowledge management is still Western centered. This paper posits that by understanding the best fit of organizational culture to knowledge management methods, organizations will have a greater opportunity to implement effective knowledge management systems. Specifically, we introduce several propositions relating cultural fit, as understood by Hofstede’s (1980) cultural dimensions, to knowledge management strategies, as outlined in Earl’s Knowledge Management Taxonomy (2001). Several organizations are identified that exhibit various knowledge management strategies and several countries are identified for each cultural dimension to show how these categorizations relate to the real business world. If organizational success is important to managers in this age of globalization, they must recognize how culture affects the way people share knowledge. Using our framework, executives and managers can encourage the development of knowledge management systems that take cultural dimensions into consideration and promote a higher degree of knowledge sharing. The propositions presented in this paper also help to illustrate how each cultural dimension is not limited to a best fit with only one knowledge management school but can fit well with several of the schools. This allows for more flexibility in creating knowledge management systems in diverse cultural settings. Different mixes of approaches may be needed for organizations that span across countries with significantly different cultures Future research is needed to test our propositions in organizational settings. Since the Earl Knowledge Management Taxonomy is based on observations of current organizations, these organizations would be a natural setting for ongoing research. Studying international organizations would also be beneficial, since they would allow the comparison of common company strategies operating under different cultural dimensions. Lastly, longitudinal qualitative studies would be valuable since they could lead to a greater understanding of how the best fit between various cultures and knowledge management schools can contribute to a sustained competitive advantage.",,2,0,,,,undefined,,8890996200,Gabriel Giordano,Gabriel,Giordano,Tenure,Professor,Analytics and Information Systems Faculty,,8890996200,,,,,,2002-2003

For this purpose, a stochastic model of sales propagation among consumers is developed. This model utilizes a compartmentalized schema denoted as a Markov Chain where the local network effects impact transition rates. A key aspect of the proposed model is its multilayer structure, where products’ information streams through different layers. The equilibrium conditions and the optimal pricing strategies in a competitive market are examined. The pricing problem is investigated in two settings of homogeneous and heterogeneous (i.e., differential). It is shown that the existence and coexistence of individual products in the equilibrium point depends on an epidemic parameter, called reproduction number, that quantifies the speed by which a product's sales spread over the network. Moreover, it is found that the correlation between the network's layers impacts the equilibrium point. Specifically, a negative correlation between the network's layers allows a wider coexistence region than a positive correlation. Additionally, it is found that a negative correlation between the network's layers provides more flexibility to firms for their pricing practices and yields a higher profit. Finally, different pricing strategies are characterized with respect to model parameters and the centrality measures of different networks.

We analyze the following three problems separately; first, we maximize the smallest nonzero eigenvalue, also known as the algebraic connectivity; second, we minimize the largest eigenvalue, also known as the spectral radius; and finally, we minimize the spectral width. Maximizing the algebraic connectivity requires identical weights on the interlayer edges for budgets less than a threshold value. However, for larger budgets, the optimal weights are generally nonuniform. The dual formulation transforms the problem into a graph realization (embedding) problem that allows us to give a fuller picture. Namely, before the threshold budget, the optimal realization is one-dimensional with nodes in the same layer embedded to a single point, while beyond the threshold, the optimal embeddings generally unfold into spaces with dimension bounded by the multiplicity of the algebraic connectivity. Finally, for extremely large budgets the embeddings again revert to lower dimensions. Minimizing the largest eigenvalue is driven by the spectral radius of the individual networks and its corresponding eigenvector. Before a threshold, the total budget is distributed among interlayer edges corresponding to the nodal lines of this eigenvector, and the optimal largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian remains constant. For larger budgets, the weight distribution tends to be almost uniform. In the dual picture, the optimal graph embedding is one-dimensional and nonhomogeneous at first, with the nodes corresponding to the layer with the largest spectral radius distributed on a line according to its eigenvector, while the other layer is embedded at the origin.

Research also shows that government intervention is an important factor in controlling the emission volume produced by waste management systems. This study considers a base E-waste supply chain in which a collection center is responsible for collecting E-waste and delivering it to a recycling center. The recycling center recovers valuable material and sells it to electronic device manufacturing companies using a price/sustainability-sensitive demand. E-waste material recovery generates emissions that are undesirable for manufacturing companies. Two extended cases regarding the base supply chain are studied, as well: (1) the recycling center is also active in E-waste collection. (2) There are two active recycling centers. Although the sustainability-sensitive demand is a controlling factor for material recovery emissions, government interferences through tariff and emission penalties make sure that sustainable issues are considered in the material recovery process. Each plant in this study makes a marginal profit by processing E-waste; therefore, it is important to know which plant is the primary decision-maker when it comes to price. Because of its capability in terms of solving interactive decision-making problems, game theory is used to model different scenarios in our problem. Equilibrium values are derived, and a numerical example with parameter sensitivity analysis is provided to show the applicability of the proposed models. The results show that the E-waste supply chain makes more profit and selects a higher level of material recovery sustainability if the plants work under a centralized decision-making framework. Moreover, it is more profitable for the entire E-waste supply chain if the recycling center undertakes a portion of the E-waste collection activity.",E-waste management | Material recovery | Nash equilibrium | Recycling emission | Stackelberg game | Sustainability,10,0,,,,undefined,,55625571400,Ehsan Ardjmand,Ehsan,Ardjmand,Tenure,Associate Professor,Analytics and Information Systems Faculty,0000-0002-0166-2159,55625571400,,,,,,2019-2020

Every micrograph undergoes the K-means clustering algorithm for accurate separation of phases before it is used in calculation of the metrics. Finally, the protocol relies on analysis of variance to verify the meaningfulness of results. The protocol is applied to study homogeneity and particle size distribution in MMCs consisting of Cu-matrix with 20 vol.%-SiC The composites were processed using high pressure torsion and double torsion to a different number of torsional turns. During processing, particles fragment and form clusters of fragments. As straining continues, the clusters of fragments disperse in the matrix. A decrease and then increase of the H-metric demonstrate that the metric can pick up these processes occurring in the microstructure.

Such a technical commitment comes with a cost; particularly, the generation of large, high-dimensional data streams ('Big Data') that personnel must search through to identify data structures. Nature-inspired computation, inclusive of artificial neural networks (ANNs), affords the unearthing of complex, recurring patterns within sizable data volumes. In 2009, select meteorological and hydrological data were acquired via autonomous instruments in Sarasota Bay, Florida (USA). ANNs estimated continuous chlorophyll (CHL) a concentrations from abiotic predictors, with correlations between measured:modeled concentrations >0.90 and model efficiencies ranging from 0.80 to 0.90. Salinity and water temperature were the principal influences for modeled CHL within the Bay; concentrations steadily increased at temperatures >28°C and were greatest at salinities <36 (maximizing at ca. 35.3). Categorical ANNs modeled CHL classes of 6.1 and 11μgCHLL-1 (representative of local and state-imposed constraint thresholds, respectively), with an accuracy of ca. 83% and class precision ranging from 0.79 to 0.91. The occurrence likelihood of concentrations > 6.1μgCHLL-1 maximized at a salinity of ca. 36.3 and a temperature of ca. 29.5°C. A 10th-order Chebyshev bivariate polynomial equation was fit (adj. r2=0.99, p<0.001) to a three-dimensional response surface portraying modeled CHL concentrations, conditional to the temperature-salinity interaction. The TREPAN algorithm queried a continuous ANN to extract a decision tree for delineation of CHL classes; turbidity, temperature, and salinity (and to lesser degrees, wind speed, wind/current direction, irradiance, and urea-nitrogen) were key variables for quantitative rules in tree formalisms. Taken together, computations enabled knowledge provision for and quantifiable representations of the non-linear relationships between environmental variables and CHL a. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Artificial neural networks | Decision trees | Empirical models | Environmental informatics | In situ chlorophyll | Sarasota Bay,15,0,,,NOAA,NA10NOS4190178,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,55625571400,Ehsan Ardjmand,Ehsan,Ardjmand,Tenure,Associate Professor,Analytics and Information Systems Faculty,0000-0002-0166-2159,55625571400,,,,,,2012-2013

An analysis of reaction-time data further indicated that the response times were shorter for heuristic judgments than for knowledge-only-based judgments. Furthermore, when knowledge was available, the response times were shorter when knowledge was congruent with a heuristic cue than when it was in conflict with it.

Reliance on self-standards contrasts with the legal standard of the reasonably prudent person (RPP) standard, which presumably represents the behavior of the average person in the community. In three studies that investigated judgments of harmful actions, we compared the influence of self-standards (“How likely would I behave in this manner?”) and RPP estimates (“How likely would the average, reasonable person in the community behave in this manner?”). In each study, self-standards influenced participants’ judgments of guilt and the acceptability of the defendant's actions more than did judgments about what a RPP would do. Studies 2a and 2b also investigated attitudinal differences in susceptibility to RPP consensus manipulations. Participants judged a target who committed murder in self-defense, and also projected their own hypothetical behavior in the scenario. When the manipulated RPP disapproved of the murder, the target was deemed more culpable, but only among participants who themselves were unwilling to commit the hypothetical act. Participants who expressed willingness to murder in self-defense were unaffected by RPP information, regardless of whether or not it was consistent with their own stance. Hence, RPP information at best exerted minimal influence on juridical judgments, and only among certain participants. Implications of these findings for legal applications of the RPP, and for the role of the self in social judgment, are discussed.",,3,0,,,,undefined,,55845304100,Ellen Gordon,Ellen,Gordon,Instructional,Associate Professor,Analytics and Information Systems Faculty,,55845304100,Journal of Applied Social Psychology,0021-9029,High Quality,,,2019-2020

In this study, we pose various behavioral scenarios to research participants and ask them to indicate whether the actor in the scenario behaved hypocritically. We assess many of the components that have been considered to be necessary for hypocrisy (e.g., the intent to deceive, self-deception), factors that may or may not be distinguished from hypocrisy (e.g., weakness of will), and factors that may moderate hypocrisy (e.g., the degree of discrepancy between the attitude and behavior, whether the attitude is stated publicly, and the nature and severity of the behavioral consequences). Our findings indicate that lay conceptions of hypocrisy are often at odds with philosophical speculation. We argue that a complete understanding of the criteria for hypocrisy requires consideration of how ordinary people construe the concept. In contrast to some concepts (e.g., physical causation), for which lay conceptions, while interesting, are largely irrelevant, hypocrisy is an essential component of social judgment. One could argue, therefore, that folk wisdom is the ultimate arbiter of what hypocrisy entails. We note limitations of our methodology and suggest avenues for future research.

One important factor related to the adoption and diffusion of communication innovations is critical mass. Critical mass influences the adoption and diffusion of interactive communication innovations, both through network externalities and through sustainability of the innovation. Unfortunately, critical mass is difficult to measure and is typically only demonstrable after the critical mass point has been reached. Potential adopters perceptions of critical mass also may be important to adoption decisions. In this paper, we extend this thinking using a synthesis of the Theory of Reasoned Action and Diffusion of Innovation theory by developing a research model. The model is empirically tested using survey data that are analyzed using partial least squares. The focal innovation is instant messaging. Results indicate that perceived critical mass influences use intentions directly and through perceptions of the characteristics of the innovation. The perceived innovation characteristics impact attitude toward use, which in turn impacts use intentions. The model predicts a sizable and significant portion of both attitudes and use intentions. Further, perceived critical mass is able to explain a significant portion of the variance in each perceived innovation characteristic.

Their potential benefits are far from being fully realized due to the lack of user acceptance. While there are studies that show the relevance and positive impact of group support systems on group work, very few have looked into users' perception of the groupware technologies and their motivation to participate (Nunamaker, 1997).

This study examines the use of expectancy theory in explaining the behavioral intention (motivation) to use a groupware application. Data gathered from 86 student users in a judgment modeling exercise suggest that the model is a significant predictor of users' motivation. The successful use of expectancy theory also suggests that it is appropriate for assessing and understanding users' motivation to use a groupware application and, subsequently, its acceptance and success.

By extending the technology acceptance model (TAM), this paper advances a groupware acceptance model that incorporates perceived critical mass as an independent variable for predicting groupware acceptance. The model is empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 385 students responding about their perception of Lotus Domino Discussion Databases. The results reveal that perceived critical mass had the largest total effect (direct and indirect) on intention to use groupware.

This research examines Organizational Culture during Crises (OCC) as an antecedent to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to evaluate the factors that determine the intention to adopt a virtual classroom across multiple disciplines by the faculty of a reputed Indian university. Data collected from a sample of 353 respondents was analyzed to test the research model using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings of the study reveal that OCC plays a positive and significant role in determining the intention of faculties to adopt a virtual classroom. We also found that OCC also significantly influences performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence. The results imply proper framing of policies by top management of Higher Education Institutions (HEI) for the smooth adoption of virtual classrooms by faculty when confronted by crises.",COVID | Higher Education | Organizational Culture during Crises (OCC) | Pandemic | SEM | Teaching | Technology Adoption | UTAUT | Virtual Classroom,4,0,,,,undefined,,35817340600,Vic Matta,Vic,Matta,Tenure,Associate Professor,Analytics and Information Systems Faculty,,35817340600,,,,,,2020-2021

For this purpose, a stochastic model of sales propagation among consumers is developed. This model utilizes a compartmentalized schema denoted as a Markov Chain where the local network effects impact transition rates. A key aspect of the proposed model is its multilayer structure, where products’ information streams through different layers. The equilibrium conditions and the optimal pricing strategies in a competitive market are examined. The pricing problem is investigated in two settings of homogeneous and heterogeneous (i.e., differential). It is shown that the existence and coexistence of individual products in the equilibrium point depends on an epidemic parameter, called reproduction number, that quantifies the speed by which a product's sales spread over the network. Moreover, it is found that the correlation between the network's layers impacts the equilibrium point. Specifically, a negative correlation between the network's layers allows a wider coexistence region than a positive correlation. Additionally, it is found that a negative correlation between the network's layers provides more flexibility to firms for their pricing practices and yields a higher profit. Finally, different pricing strategies are characterized with respect to model parameters and the centrality measures of different networks.

For this purpose, we develop an epidemic spreading model to explore the dynamics of a viral marketing campaign under network externalities and incentivized individuals. We will examine two cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous incentive rates. In each case, we derive an N-intertwined dynamics model and obtain the existence and stability conditions of a trade-free or an endemic equilibrium. By treating the incentive as a control parameter, we investigate the problem of maximizing the monopolist's profit by formulating two nonlinear programming models. In the case of homogeneous incentive rates, results show that the optimal incentive is determined by devising a balance between the consumers’ states in the Markov process. In the heterogeneous case, it is observed that despite the existence of a strong correlation with different centrality measures, the optimal incentive allocation cannot be solely determined by centrality measures.",Dynamical systems over networks | Epidemic spread | Incentive rate determination | Nonlinear programming | OR in marketing,7,0,,,,undefined,,23013584800,William Young,William,Young,Tenure,Professor,Analytics and Information Systems Faculty,,23013584800,European Journal of Operations Research,0377-2217,Top,,,2020-2021

One of the main factors to measure EPB is a structure's heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL). HLs and CLs depend on several variables, such as relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution. This research uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to forecast HLs and CLs for a variety of structures. The DNNs explored in this research include multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks, and each of the models in this research was developed through extensive testing with a myriad number of layers, process elements, and other data preprocessing techniques. As a result, a DNN is shown to be an improvement for modeling HLs and CLs compared to traditional artificial neural network (ANN) models. In order to extract knowledge from a trained model, a post-processing technique, called sensitivity analysis (SA), was applied to the model that performed the best with respect to the selected goodness-of-fit metric on an independent set of testing data. There are two forms of SA - local and global methods - but both have the same purpose in terms of determining the significance of independent variables within a model. Local SA assumes inputs are independent of each other, while global SA does not. To further the contribution of the research presented within this article, the results of a global SA, called state-based sensitivity analysis (SBSA), are compared to the results obtained from a traditional local technique, called sensitivity analysis about the mean (SAAM).

In literature, there are segmentation-based approaches, which try to parse the reviews based on the features/aspects they mention and assign opinions to those segments. It is observed that the existing models can perform better with an improved underlying segmentation model. This research aims to propose an improved segmentation model, named IMAS, to fill the gap in an existing multi-aspect segmentation model (MAS). Two aspect-opinion extraction systems were developed with two different segmentation models, and they are compared based upon their overall accuracy.

In this paper, a new robust multi-product and multi-period model for planning and pricing is proposed. The demand is considered to be uncertain and price-dependent. Thus, for each price, a range of demands is possible. The unsatisfied demand is considered to be lost and hence, no backlogging is allowed. The objective is to maximise the profit over the planning horizon, which consists of a finite number of periods. To solve the proposed model, a modified unconscious search (US) algorithm is introduced. Several artificial test problems along with a real case implementation of the model in a textile manufacturing plant are used to show the applicability of the model and effectiveness of the US for tackling this problem.

However, ANNs exhibit a holistic deficiency in declarative knowledge structure (i.e. a 'black-box'). The architecture of the Grey-Box provided the benefit of the ANN modeling structure, while deconvolving the interaction of prediction potentials among environmental variables upon CHL a. The influences of (pairs of) predictors upon the variance and magnitude of CHL a were depicted via pedagogical knowledge extraction (multi-dimensional response surfaces). This afforded derivation of mathematical equations for iterative predictive outcomes of CHL a and together with an algorithmic expression across iterations, corrected for the lack of declarative knowledge within conventional ANNs. Importantly, the Grey-Box 'bridged the gap' between 'white-box' parametric models and black-box ANNs in terms of performance and mathematical transparency.

The developed algorithm was based on the theories of the positive selection algorithm and the clonal selection principle. To test the algorithm, ten job shop scheduling problems were evaluated using the new AIS model. To validate the results, the same job scheduling problems were evaluated using a genetic algorithm (GA) model. The results of the two evaluations were compared against each other using the dimensions of optimality and robustness. The testing revealed that the AIS model was slightly less competitive than the GA model in the optimality test but beat the GA in robustness. Another key finding was that the robustness of the model increased as the best solutions produced by the model were closer to the known optimal. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",Artificial immune systems | Genetic algorithms | Job shop | Scheduling,10,0,,,,undefined,,23013584800,William Young,William,Young,Tenure,Professor,Analytics and Information Systems Faculty,,23013584800,Neural Computing and Applications,0941-0643,High Quality,Analytics,,2012-2013

RFID tracking systems are being used to locate tagged objects in indoor environments, however; reliability is low due to interferences. To overcome this limitation, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be used to determining a device's location in the proximity of interference. This research presents a proof of concept to an industrial application of using ANNs as an RFID localization algorithm when objects are subjected to metallic and human interference. To prove this concept, random samples are collected using the received signal strength indication (RSSI) values from passive RFID readers and antennas. The test results show that ANNs can determine the location of a passive RFID tag accurately in the presence of noise and shows that data preprocessing techniques can improve the predictive capabilities of the ANN-RFID localization algorithm. Significance: Research shows that passive tags are better suited for tracking items that are high volume, low cost, or have a short shelf life. A passive RFID tag system is explored in this research due to the inexpensive nature of the tags. Thus, there is a great potential for many industrial applications if advancements are made to increase the reliability of determining a tag's location. Constructing an ANN-RFID localization algorithm is significant because ANNs are capable of predicting non-linear, noisy, or incomplete readings that are obtain from RFID antennas.

With this approach, the valuer uses the current market capitalization as a fixed input and seeks those ‘critical’ values of individual valuation parameters, which–assuming all other parameters remain unchanged–result in a value equal to current market value. This provides a point of comparison for the company’s realized performance and may provide insights regarding over or undervaluation.

In multivariate analyses, the authors then examine whether this loss of coverage differs across geographic region, firm size and capital market development, and whether it is associated with consensus analyst accuracy. Findings: Results indicate that between 2011 and 2021, firm-specific analyst coverage globally declined 17.8%, while the decline in the EU was an even greater, 28.5%.

We observe a negative association of excess insider control and firms’ CSR performance, primarily with respect to the community- and employee-related dimensions of CSR. Extended analyses reveal that this negative association is mitigated by high financial resource availability. Consistent with a trade-off between corporate spending on CSR or on benefits for insiders, we also observe a negative association between CSR performance and executive pay in dual-class firms. Taken together, these extended analyses are consistent with self-interested behavior of entrenched insiders who, unless resources are abundant, appear to reduce CSR activities to maintain resources available for their personal benefit.

Better AQ implies a more precise estimate of future cash flows and, we predict, a reduction in credit spreads due to resulting lower uncertainty regarding the ability to meet debt interest and principal payments. In support of this hypothesis, we find a negative relationship between AQ and CDS spreads whereby better AQ is associated with lower CDS spreads. Additionally, we investigate the components of total AQ and find that innate AQ is more strongly associated with CDS spreads than is discretionary AQ. We further show that AQ moderates the market's pricing of earnings: the relationship between earnings and CDS spreads weakens as AQ worsens.

The analyses explore audit production costs, profitability, and partner compensation at the audit-firm level, using publicly available data from the U.K. The findings suggest interesting potential differences in audit production functions between the Big Four firms, an important factor when considering the competitiveness of the audit market. Taking this analysis and applying it to the U.S. setting, an estimate of the average profitability per domestic Big Four partner is approximately $1.2 million for the year 2013.

Moreover, rubrics may improve qualitative feedback on learning to students and instructors. Development of effective rubrics is framed in terms of learning goals, measurable learning outcomes, choice of assessment vehicle/assignment, and use of data collected from rubrics for feedback and/or improvement. The paper then offers an example set of rubrics designed to assess student achievement of three learning goals common to many undergraduate accounting programs: accounting measurement, research, and critical thinking. This paper may prove useful for instructors looking to use rubrics to improve the teaching-learning process and concurrently evaluate learning goal achievement for course or program assessment.

Bonus depreciation has been extended to allow an immediate 100%o deduction for eligible property, which also now includes used property. This bonus depreciation will be phased out over a nine-year period. Additionally, the progressive marginal tax rate used for business income has been eliminated and replaced by a flat 21%o tax rate, representing a 14%o drop in the tax rate on businesses. Specifically, this case will examine how a change from 50% to 100%o bonus depreciation affects purchasing decisions between asset classes, due to the exaggerated impact on the net present value for longer lived assets. In keeping with the evolution of accounting in academia, students will be asked both to solve a realistic problem and to communicate their investment decisions effectively. To prepare students for the assignment, the informational building blocks are presented in modules following Bloom’s taxonomy – culminating in the application of the concepts in a decision-making scenario. The learning method applied in this case has been tested in the classroom, with quantifiable results showing a positive learning outcome. Pre- and post-case assessment questions were administered with significant improvement in students reported understanding across all six measures.

Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change are high on the agenda of both policymakers and researchers who increasingly acknowledge the criticality of innovative measures to support those efforts. However, it is still unclear how climate change factors and innovative capabilities affect food production in the long run, especially for developing countries, which are most threatened by climate change. Using an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) cointegration approach, this study evaluates the long-run effects of climate change and innovative capabilities on food production in Algeria over the period 1970–2019. To do so, food production is posited as a function of a set of climate change variables (CO2 emissions, mean temperatures, and mean precipitations) and innovative capabilities (human and physical capital). The novelty of this approach helps to tease out the distinct effects of these factors on food production, both in the long run and the short run. The results not only support the presence of long-run relationships between the variables but also show that, while precipitations, human capital, and physical capital positively affect food production, temperatures have a negative relationship with food production. Moreover, CO2 emissions do not appear to have a long-run effect on food production, at least not directly. In the short run, results confirm that food production is positively related to precipitation and stock of physical capital. Results from this study thus suggest that mitigating climate change impacts and ensuring food security, especially in developing countries, will require investments in agricultural innovation.",Algeria | Autoregressive distributed lag model | Climate change | Food production | Innovative capabilities,0,0,,,,undefined,,55626819400,Rachida Aissaoui,Rachida,Aissaoui,Tenure,Associate Professor,Management Faculty,,55626819400,,,,,,2022-2023

We first review perspectives that offer competing evidence about the role of globalization in regard to economic development and corruption. Drawing on resource dependence and institutional theory, we test the two contingencies of the country’s stage of economic development (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, high) and the globalization dimension (economic, social, political) at play to reconcile competing findings. Using a cross-lagged panel design, we show that these contingencies significantly explain when and what type of globalization can benefit a country’s economy and affect corruption. In doing so, the study provides a platform for future research, and identifies important patterns that can better guide policymaking. Among other results, we find low-income countries’ GDP and corruption benefit the most from the formal dimensions of globalization. With increased wealth, countries are more responsive to the legitimacy accrued with the informal dimensions of globalization, which we find comes at the expense of economic efficiency for high-income countries.",corruption | cross-lagged panel design | economic development | formal and informal institutions | globalization | longitudinal methods | resource dependence,6,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,,55626819400,Rachida Aissaoui,Rachida,Aissaoui,Tenure,Associate Professor,Management Faculty,,55626819400,,,,,,2021-2022

The aim of this study is to assess the effects of climate change on agricultural production in Algeria during the period 1966–2016. Findings from a simultaneous equations model show that the agricultural yield is positively affected by rainfall and negatively impacted by CO2 emissions. The latter are positively related to temperatures, which leads over time to aggravate the warming climate phenomenon. The results further show that GDP per capita indirectly lowers agricultural yield through its effects on CO2 emissions.

The study makes use of state-of-the-art analytical framework based on a unified approach to reveal insights from the present body of knowledge and the potentials for future research developments. Design/methodology/approach: Unlike standard literature reviews, in SLR, a structured approach is followed. The approach enables utilizing contemporary tools and software packages such as R-package “bibliometrix” and Gephi for exploratory and visual analytics. A number of clustering methods are employed to form clusters. Later, multivariate analysis methodologies are adopted to determine the dominant clusters for the influential co-cited references. Findings: Using contemporary tools from Bibliometric Analysis (BA), the authors identify in an exploratory analysis, the influential authors, sources, regions, affiliations and papers. In addition, the use of network analysis tools reveals research clusters, topological analysis, key research topics, interrelation and authors’ collaboration along with their patterns. Finally, the optimum number of clusters computed for cluster analysis is decided using a systematic procedure based on multivariate analysis such as k-means and factor analysis. Originality/value: Modern-day supply chains increasingly depend on developing superior insights from large amounts of data available from diverse sources in unstructured and semi-structured formats. In order to maintain a competitive edge, the supply chains need to perform speedy analysis of big data using efficient tools that provide real-time decision-making insights.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a cross-sectional time-lagged research design by collecting data from 483 knowledge workers in Pakistan's healthcare and universities, both public and private. The authors used structural equation modeling using AMOS 25.0 software to examine the proposed relationships’ mediation, moderation and moderated-mediation processes, such as Hayes (2018) process models 1,7,14 and 58. In addition, the authors tested a structural model with self-developed estimands instead of using process macros available in SPSS by computing variables. Findings: The results of this study confirmed that CRJR predicts job crafting and employees' sustainable employability. Furthermore, comprehensive testing suggested that mediation of job crafting between CRJR and sustainable employability further strengthened in the presence of a boundary condition of work uncertainty. Originality/value: The study uncovers CRJR (job, organizational, social and relational) as a predictor of job crafting. The authors suggest that job design integrating CRJR helps organizations and managers promote job crafting and make employees responsible for their sustainable employability. The proposed CRJR has not been used as a predictor of job crafting, and no such study tested CRJR as a predictor of sustainable employability.

Design/methodology/approach: Data for the study have been gathered in two distinct surveys from 300 employees working at the managerial level in various manufacturing companies of Pakistan with a seven-week time interval to reduce common method variance. Data were collected during January and March 2020. Confirmatory factor analysis has been performed before testing the mediated model. Findings: Organization non-monetary CDIMS i.e. control over work hours and supervisor support has been associated positively with WFB, which has further mediated the relationship between workplace non-monetary CDIMS and employee professional outcomes. Research limitations/implications: Both supervisor support and control over work hours improve employee outcomes by experiencing the satisfaction with WFB. It has been recommended that organizations embed cross-domain interventions in their job design to benefit all employees impartially.

Unlike prior studies that examined some such factors. Based on real-world data from a window manufacturing MNC, a mixed integer linear programming model is developed and solved using CPLEX Solver. It reveals how the different features affect the base solution. Specifically, increased demand pushes more manufacturing to US and UK facilities rather than (low-cost) Chinese facilities; it helps meets some of China’s demand and leads to reduced total tariff costs. Decreased demand instead favors the Chinese facility, and the increase in tariff costs can be offset by savings in manufacturing and transportation costs. Changes to the factors have insignificant effects on the production and distribution mix, with little to no impact on total profits, because these costs are lower than capacity costs. The comprehensive proposed model provides firms with a framework for obtaining meaningful insights into how they can maintain their operations in sustainable, profitable ways.

In this paper, the manufacturer in its supply chain, faces uncertain market demand environment. Based on the products, operations and demand information, the manufacturer makes decisions to design its manufacturing system that saves time and effort in the production process. The methodology followed in this paper includes four phases. In Phase 1, the manufacturer benefits from the grouping of the similar products into families to save time and effort in the production and eventually the related machines are formed accordingly. In Phase 2, the decision of manufacturing system layout or design, considering a stochastic customer demand, is made including cellular manufacturing system design. In Phase 3, the expected profits generated by the system designed to meet the demand of product families are determined and optimal design is selected accordingly. In Phase 4, the problem of determining the optimal profits and quantities of the individual products in families, considering multi-demand coverage levels, is tackled using a proposed mathematical model, then results are analyzed. The results showed that similar products are grouped into four product families using p-median mathematical model and machine cells are formed accordingly. Consequently, the cellular manufacturing systems is designed for each family and the decision on the optimal number of cells is made based on the maximum expected profits generated by the system designed. Further, the problem of finding the optimal profits by individual products in families is studied considering three demand coverage probability scenarios: non-demand coverage restriction, only lower bound-demand coverage restriction and both lower and upper bounds-demand coverage restriction. Maximum profits are generated when the decision does not include any restriction on the demand; however, the product that has the lowest processing time is produced and sold where other products are not. This may leave the decision maker with either keep-the-winner perspective or not depending on the policy implemented in the competition process. Better decisions are made when more information is shared about the customer requirements.",Expected shortage cost | Manufacturing system design | Manufacturing-supply chain | Optimal profits | Product family-cell formation problem | Stochastic demand,6,0,,,,undefined,,14218935100,Mohammed Khurrum Bhutta,Mohammed,Bhutta,Tenure,Professor,Management Faculty,0000-0001-9803-8020,14218935100,International Journal of Production Economics,0925-5273,Top,,,2020-2021

CE is a dual-loop regenerative system that focuses on the effective and efficient utilization of resources in the ecosystem, which is beneficial to environmental and economic performance optimization. Dual CE initiatives allow firms to increased resource eco-efficiency, as well as resource effectiveness. CE has profound consequences for economic and operational advantage. This reinforces the need for reflection on the definition that may provide guidelines to assess and advance the depth and diversity of the field. We aim to provide a definitional analysis of the CE and suggest future research streams to advance the existing literature. For this purpose, we employed a systematic literature review to collect related publications in the CE. As a result of this, a total of 91 papers were selected, studied, and analyzed. We proposed a sound definition of a circular economy that includes the main identified elements, organizational planning processes, customers and society, utilization of the ecosystem, and economic resource flows. Moreover, future direction agenda, in CE research, is suggested considering three research streams: (1) circular design as value creation and capture, (2) antecedents of key activities, and (3) consequences of key processes. There is limited empirical research conducted on CE, and much of the existing research focuses on theoretical, conceptual, and normative. A few empirical research studies are mainly cross-sectional in their focus and are confined to developing and emerging economies. We hope this study’s findings will extend the field of CE, in which some of the most influential information regarding CE literature is provided. This study suggests that the development of CE initiatives plays an important role in the growing digital transformation in the value chain.

Findings: Results show that lean manufacturing, AM, and supporting management and infrastructural practices have positive and complementary effects on firm's performance. Further, results depict that lean manufacturing and AM complementarity is a complete organizational synergistic phenomenon, and piecemeal implementation of these initiatives may lead to suboptimal or unsatisfactory results. Results also indicate that there is no significant direct (correlated and uncorrelated) relationship of management, infrastructure, lean manufacturing, and AM practices with firm's performance and support that lean manufacturing and AM are not competing paradigms.

In this regard, current study assessed the direct and indirect environmental footprint of 33 U.S. food manufacturing sectors by using the Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) model. Then, a non-parametric mathematical optimization tool, namely Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), is utilized to benchmark the sustainability performance of food manufacturing sectors by using the results of the EIO-LCA model. Next, sustainability performance indices (SPIs), rankings, target improvements, and sensitivity of environmental impact indicators are presented. The average SPI score of U.S. food manufacturing sectors is found as 0.76. In addition, 19 out of 33 food sectors are found as inefficient where an average of 45-71% reduction is indicated for various environmental impact categories. Analysis results also indicate that supply chains of food manufacturing sectors are heavily responsible for the impacts with over 80% shares for energy, water and carbon footprint, fishery and grazing categories. Especially, animal (except poultry) slaughtering, rendering and processing sector is found as the most dominant sector in most of the impact categories (ranked as 2nd in fishery and forest land). Sensitivity analysis indicated that forest land footprint is found to be the most sensitive environmental indicator on the overall sustainability performance of food manufacturing sectors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a model which reconciles many of these inefficiencies by integrating production factors, purchasing, inventory, and trucking decisions for optimizing supply chain costs between first-, and second-tier suppliers and subsequent OEM customers. Design/methodology/approach - The modeling technique is mathematical programming tested in a simulation model. In an effort to determine the significance of the transportation component of the proffered model, the fully developed model is differentially tested, including standard production variables varying transportation costs, paired with similar instances of the model in which the transportation costs are fixed. Findings - Significant differences are found in the predictive abilities of the respective models, and this supplies pragmatic evidence of the important role that transportation issues play in the consideration of integrated SCM costs. Research limitations/implications - The key limitation to this finding lies in the validation process. As suggested by Sargent, Monte-Carlo studies are useful for validation purposes, and the supply chain optimization model (MHSCM) is certainly confirmed through this particular simulation. Practical implications - The managerial focus on transportation management and cost control in SCM can be highlighted as a critical implication of the study. Originality/value - The structure of the MHSCM is robust, and may be useful for cost-control planning purposes in a dynamic environment, subject to certain limitations accruing to the methodology. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Distribution management | Simulation | Supply chain management | Transportation,11,0,,,,undefined,,14218935100,Mohammed Khurrum Bhutta,Mohammed,Bhutta,Tenure,Professor,Management Faculty,0000-0001-9803-8020,14218935100,Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management,1741-038X,High Quality,,,2009-2010

In fact, Southern University of New Orleans (SUNO) has chosen e-learning as an element of its quality enhancement program (QEP), to enhance the quality of education and instruction especially for first year freshmen. However, despite the administration of pre-mastery tests at the beginning of every semester along with an extensive workshop by the e-learning department, students still do not get motivated in their daily performance in a timely fashion. The reason behind this phenomenon is most likely the lack of good oriented learning, a deficiency in mentoring from K-12, and social-economic constraints on the students' time. As a result, administrators and scholars at SUNO have spent countless hours and resources addressing reasons for this lack of student participation.

Design/methodology/approach - A survey of 651 SMEs from the manufacturing sector of Pakistan was conducted in 2003 and statistical analysis was carried out to analyze the data. This paper focuses on the relationship between the health indicators namely, sales/employee, increase/decrease in sales, and investment plans and the different personal characteristics of the owner/entrepreneur. Findings - This analysis suggests that education, generation setting up the business, and number of partners have a significant relationship with the health of SMEs. Health of the firm is also dependent on owner habits like watching television, reading newspapers and using computers for office work. Other factors like caste of the owner and occupation of the owner's relatives were also analyzed, but no significant relationship with the health of an SME was observed. Practical implications - The implications of this study are far reaching in understanding the profiles of owners of SMEs in Pakistan and how these profiles impact the profitability of the firms. Originality/value - To date no other such study has been carried out in Pakistan.

Design/methodology/approach - The Small and Medium Enterprise Center (SMEC) at the Lahore University of Management Sciences undertook a survey in 2003 to gauge the health of this sector. A survey of 650 firms in ten districts in the country was conducted. This paper presents the results and analyses of the supply chain practices of these SMEs. Research limitations/implications - There is dearth of independent data and research in the field of SME's in Pakistan. This paper provides a window to the supply chain practices of SME's in Pakistan and will enable future researchers to use this research as a building block in understanding these practices and the factors that pertain to successful firms. Practical implications - The implications of this study are far reaching enabling trainers, consultants, donor agencies, and entrepreneurs in the SME sector to learn the practices of successful firms and adopt/help SMEs adopt these in their operations. Findings - This paper we report some of the results of the survey and our analysis of factors related to supply chain management practices that seem to correlate with the health of the enterprise. The analysis shows that successful firms on average had more products, more customers as well as more new customers. SMEs into exports were the healthiest and exhibited most dynamic characteristics, followed by those that sold to OEMs. Another interesting insight is that growing firms sold more directly to end users while firms with higher sales per employee sold the least to the end user. Originality/value - A major frustration for most policy researchers in the SME area is the virtual non-existence of scientific data on this sector in the country.

Yet, emerging theory and anecdotal evidence suggest that, within organizations, there is considerable variation between departments or units regarding how employees' lives outside work are supported. Despite top management's efforts to develop a unified organizational work-family culture, departments have a tendency to take on their own culture, norms, and traditions such that some are more supportive than others. Purpose: We investigate whether more positive work-family cultures improve functioning within hospital departments. Methodology/Approach: We surveyed 680 hospital employees nested within 60 departments at a hospital located in the southeastern United States. Results: Departments with a more (vs. less) positive work-family culture tend to have higher levels of (a) employee engagement, (b) pride in their organization, (c) confidence in management and leadership, and (d) intention to remain with the organization. Our analyses were robust when splitting the sample between clinical (e.g., nurses and physicians) and nonclinical (e.g., office, clerical, and support services) roles. Conclusion: Our study sheds further light on the importance of a positive work-family culture within hospitals. The key to instilling a positive, organization-wide work-family culture may be through a department-by-department focus. Practice Implications: Benefits of positive work-family cultures within departments can extend beyond job-related attitudes and can potentially enhance recruitment strategies, improve a hospital's external image to the public, and lead to improvements in patient care and more positive patient experiences.",family supportive supervision | job attitudes | organizational culture | work-family balance | work-family culture,4,0,,,,undefined,,57190971115,David Boss,David,Boss,Tenure,Associate Professor,Management Faculty,,57190971115,,,,,,2019-2020

Inventor networks are key conduits through which knowledge flows. Therefore, they can be critical in the catch-up process of peripheral economies - economies that belong to the group of rich countries but have weaker innovation systems. As global value chains fragment into geographically dispersed activities, opportunities arise for peripheral economies to participate in global innovation processes. However, different types of innovation activities have distinct network properties. More codifiable innovative activities can be carried out through collaboration by internationally dispersed teams. On the other hand, activities that are more dependent on tacit knowledge are likely to require the co-location of knowledge workers. This implies that innovation that relies mostly on tacit knowledge will provide limited connectivity benefits for peripheral economies' innovation systems. We hypothesize that, while this is generally true, ""leading""innovative multinational enterprises may possess more sophisticated capabilities for transnational collaboration than less innovative firms. Therefore, innovation in activities involving tacit knowledge may show different network characteristics depending on who performs them: leading firms or ""laggards"".

The authors argue that the geographical pattern of international connectivity is characterized by local concentration and strong connections to foreign multinational enterprises, for which a large number of inventors in Spain work. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis was done using data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office database, covering almost 40 years, ranging from 1976 to 2014. The authors used patents in the ICT sector connected to either inventors or organizations located in Spain. The authors analyzed collaboration by the location of both inventors and assignees, and the connections established across borders. Second, the authors assessed the level of concentration and dispersion that characterizes these relationships. Findings: First, the growth of the ICT sector in Spain is strongly driven by linkages with foreign companies, in particular those located in the USA. Second, the interaction of local and international clusters of knowledge generation is a key driver of the ICT sector, which is far from being global. Third, there is a geographic concentration of national/international knowledge sources, which is mediated by the technological strategies of internationalized firms. Therefore, the new information age seems to be highly dependent on the collaboration between individuals and companies through focal local points, and on the prevalence of co-developed international inventions. Research limitations/implications: Understanding the patterns of ICT-related knowledge creation and its geographical footprint is crucial to foster competitiveness in the digital age. The transition from a paradigm based on tangible assets to one where competitive advantage stems mainly from intangibles, has significant implications for both policy and practice. International collaboration presents opportunities to enhance competitiveness at various levels, be that organizations, regions or countries. To seize these opportunities, it is key to enhance the endogenous capabilities and absorptive capacity of the local players. While patent data captures the output of a national innovation system only partially, it is still a suitable indicator to capture international connectedness. More qualitative-oriented techniques, however, may allow for a better assessment of tacit knowledge flows. Originality/value: The creation of knowledge in high-tech industries is a key aspect of competitiveness, and it is increasingly supported by collaboration that spans across borders. However, knowledge creation adopts different patterns, depending on the unique characteristics of the country. The authors analyze the case of Spain, a developed economy with pockets of innovation but also significant areas that can be considered “peripheral,” both economically and industrially, when compared to much of Western Europe.

We advance this literature by making three key arguments. First we highlight the three megatrends that shape the strategy of the modern MNE: the disaggregation of the value chain into ever narrower activities, the migration of value to knowledge-intensive intangibles and the rise of huge emerging markets like China and India, whose domestic firms can grow to enormous size before venturing abroad. Second, we trace these three megatrends to falling spatial transaction costs, enabled in the main, by digitalization. Third, we draw on earlier research on the generic forms of global linkages, arguing that the IB literature has limited itself to organizational pipelines, while paying relatively little attention to personal relationships. The latter are particularly important in the genesis of both entrepreneurship and radical innovation, but are particularly sensitive to the anti-globalization policies.

It shows that ex ante, their interests converge and this lays the foundation of “catch-up alliances”: competitors open up to catch up. However, they often bring vastly different resources to the alliance and, in the process of cooperation, what they learn may cause their interests to diverge. Furthermore, some participants may discount a technology trajectory on the basis of what they learn, and terminate efforts in that area.

However, the relationship between support and openness seems to be negatively moderated by the existence of previous innovative activity within the firm. Public support has more impact on less innovative firms and less influence when the firm is already innovative, which could potentially indicate the existence of crowding-out effects. Additionally, our results suggest that nonfinancial support is more strongly linked to openness than financial support.

These studies indicate that European and Asia-Pacific business schools and their faculty members are helping to lead this transition. Aims: This study examines whether U.S. dominance of IB research has truly reached its end, or whether the extent of this transition to non-U.S. authors and institutions has been overstated. To the extent that U.S. hegemony has declined, this study examines what strategies may have assisted non-U.S. nations and their business schools to emerge as leaders in producing IB research. Materials & Methods: This study employs an in-depth, time-series analysis of the evolution of IB research over a 45-year period, 1976–2020, to examine trends in institutional and national productivity globally. Results: Despite declines in overall dominance of U.S. authors and institutions, the extent varies by type of journal and U.S. impact remains profound through Ph.D. training and collaboration. In addition, novel findings include the emergence of three distinct business models that non-U.S. institutions have followed to enhance their global rankings in publication of IB research. Discussion: We discuss the 3-part typology of strategies by which non-U.S. institutions have enhanced their productivity and international rankings.

Our study investigates this issue, specifically how a nation's adoption of creatively destroying innovations is related to two previously unexplored variables: cultural looseness, which is a norm-based measure of informal institutions, and global connectedness. To highlight potential contributions from these new variables, we control for within-nation contextual variables examined in prior research, including formal institutions, Hofstede's dimensions of cultural values, socioeconomic attributes, and between-nation economic grouping. Our empirical analysis of a specific disruptive innovation, agricultural biotechnology adoption, covers 47 nations over a 14-year period and provides broad support for the usefulness of cultural looseness and global connectedness for understanding innovation adoption. Cultural looseness is significantly related to adoption of agricultural biotech. Global connectedness dimensions of depth and breadth are not directly related to adoption, only interactively with cultural looseness. These findings highlight the role of informal institutions and global connectedness in shaping complex interactions between disruptive innovation and industrial evolution within and across nations. The findings also have implications for what public policy makers might do to influence the extent of adoption of such innovations.",Agricultural biotechnology | Creative destruction | Cultural looseness | Global connectedness | Informal institutions | Innovation,7,0,,,,undefined,,6603446009,J.

Results show that while diversity strategies vary between keiretsu and non-keiretsu firms, performance is not much different. Across time periods, performance varies considerably, but strategies are less variable. Product diversity has weak effects on firm performance only in one time period, while international diversification has negative profitability and positive growth consequences in in some periods. These results suggest first that diversification strategies and their effects on performance vary across time periods and generally produce some unexpected findings.

Yet minimal attention has been devoted to skills that might help improve performance of JVGMs and their ventures.

This study examines the relationship between self-management and JVGM performance, using both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Based on 95 responses from a sample of 39 JVs, several significant relationships were discovered between various dimensions of self-management practices and the performance of JVGMs and their JVs.

This capacity issue has led to understaffing in some hospital areas. The purpose of this paper is to examine the understaffing in hospital-unit respiratory care and the impact to error rates, specifically missed treatments rates. The moderating effects of teamwork and standardized, integrated information systems are also considered. Design/methodology/approach: Survey methodology is used for data collection of respiratory care managers within hospital units. Regression is used to test the hypotheses in this study. Findings: The regression results show that higher rates of understaffing are associated with more missed treatments. In addition, both teamwork and integrated information systems are associated with lower missed treatments. Finally, the moderating effect of teamwork is also highly significant within the model while integrated information systems are not a significant moderator. Practical implications: Managers working within understaffed hospital units can try to reduce missed treatment rates by both integrated information systems and teamwork among employees. Additional benefits can be gained from teamwork due to the indirect effects (moderating effects) as well. This indicates teamwork training can be useful for quality initiatives. Originality/value: Understaffing is associated with higher missed treatments in hospital units. Standardized, integrated information systems within a hospital are associated with less missed treatments. Furthermore, employee teamwork within a hospital unit is associated with a direct effect on missed treatment rates as well as an indirect effect by weakening the negative impact of understaffing.",Healthcare | Hospital units | Information systems | Medical staffing | Teamwork | Understaffing,8,0,,,,undefined,,56646229600,Marco Habermann,Marco,Habermann,Tenure,Associate Professor,Management Faculty,,56646229600,,,,,,2018-2019

Arguments are developed for the concrete nature of the JIT practice of “set-up time reduction” and we examine the ability of a single-item measure of this variable to predict the criterion variable (delivery performance). In addition, the study also examines the efficacy of using multiple-item measures for variables that are abstract in nature, and thereby attempts to develop a continuum of JIT constructs ranging from concrete to abstract. The results obtained by analyzing two sets of survey data show that multiple-item measures are not necessarily more valid than single-item measures for all constructs. The findings provide evidence that multiple-item measures and single-item measures for scale development should be contingent upon the nature of constructs. For concrete constructs, single-item measures are as valid as multi-item measures. Meanwhile, for abstract constructs it is important to ensure that multiple items are considered to capture the multi-dimensional nature of these constructs.

METHODS: Four-hundred eighty-one RTs at 44 hospitals responded to an online survey regarding job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and job stress. Random coefficient modeling was used for analysis and to account for the nested structure of the data. RESULTS: Higher levels of RT protocol use were associated with higher levels of job satisfaction, lower rates of turnover intentions, and lower levels of job stress. In addition, RTs with greater experience had higher levels of job satisfaction, and RTs working at teaching hospitals had lower rates of turnover intentions.

When a firm chooses to develop more innovative products and processes, product reliability outcomes become more uncertain. These uncertainties in turn may lead to unexpected warranty claims costs, as well as other costs that can Erode the advantages of an innovation leadership position. This study empirically tests these propositions using publically reported warranty and financial data from 2003 to 2013, representing 482 unique firms. Consistent with prior studies, our estimation of the direct effects of firm innovativeness on financial performance shows an inverted-u-shaped relationship. Importantly, we find that more innovative firms also experience more unexpected product failure costs, and, consistent with organizational information processing theory, the negative impacts of these costs on financial performance extend well beyond the direct costs associated with remediating warranty claims. Further, we find that this relationship is robust to differing levels of industry innovativeness. Hence, our study suggests that product failure risks associated with firm innovativeness are significant, and act to at least partially offset the financial benefits of innovation leadership. In addition, standard accounting for product warranty claims may substantially understate the true costs associated with product failures, which appear to generate significant SG&A, fixed asset, and inventory costs above and beyond direct warranty processing costs. Our study also demonstrates a novel usage of warranty claims data. We discuss the implications of these findings for both managers and researchers.",Empirical | Firm performance | Innovation strategy | Longitudinal | Product quality | Warranty claims,44,0,,,,undefined,,56646229600,Marco Habermann,Marco,Habermann,Tenure,Associate Professor,Management Faculty,,56646229600,Journal of Operations Management,0272-6963,Elite,,,2015-2016

In addition, we assess supply chain disruption risk from three perspectives: the inbound material flow from the supplier (supply side), the internal production processes (internal), and the outbound material flow to the customer (customer side) as a disruption can occur at any of these locations. We measure disruption risk in terms of stoppages in flows, reductions in flow, close calls (disruptions that were prevented at the last minute), disruption duration (time until normal operation flow was restored), and the spread of disruptions all the way through the supply chain. We use seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) to analyze our data, finding that lead times, especially supply side lead times, are significantly associated with higher levels of supply chain disruption risk. We find co-location with suppliers appears to have beneficial effects to the reduction of disruption duration, and, overall supply side factors have a higher impact when it comes to supply chain disruption risk than comparable customer side factors.",Supply Chain Design | Supply Chain Disruption Survey Research | Supply Chain Risk Management,83,0,,,,undefined,,56646229600,Marco Habermann,Marco,Habermann,Tenure,Associate Professor,Management Faculty,,56646229600,Decision Sciences,0011-7315,Top,,,2014-2015

RESULTS: Of the 9 types of respiratory care protocols assessed (ie, asthma, COPD, ARDS, hypoxemia, pneumonia, noninvasive ventilation therapy, supplemental oxygen titration and discontinuation, ventilator weaning, and bronchopulmonary hygiene), the most commonly used were for oxygen titration and ventilator weaning. Large hospitals (> 350 beds) used protocols more widely than smaller hospitals (P =.01). Respondents felt that use of protocols enhanced cost and quality of care.

The present paper attempts to integrate justice theory and research into the performance appraisal interview. A conceptual model is presented that examines the relationship between three key justice mechanisms in the performance appraisal interview. Propositions are presented regarding the influence of these mechanisms using contact points (episodes where justice mechanisms are expected) and flash points (combinations of justice mechanisms that might lead to problems) as a basis for understanding how justice works in this context.

However, few studies have examined the association between sexual and gender minority stress and diurnal cortisol in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals. The current investigation tested whether the daily experience of minority stressors is uniquely related to diurnal cortisol above and beyond general stressors. Method: One hundred and 21 sexual and gender minority young adults (aged 18–35, 54.5% female) completed initial and daily evening questionnaires for 7 consecutive days to document daily general stressors and LGBT stressors. A randomly selected subset (n = 58) also provided salivary cortisol samples at wake, 45-min postwake, 12-hr postwake, and bedtime. Results: Controlling for covariates (sex assigned at birth, wake time, bedtime, and day of the week) and general stressors, individuals who reported more LGBT stressors across the week displayed elevated cortisol levels at wake, t(491) = 9.68, p = .002 and 45-min postwake, t(492) = 6.41, p = .011, relative to individuals who reported fewer LGBT stressors. In contrast, after controlling for covariates, the frequency of general stressors only predicted cortisol 12 hr postwake, t(785) = 2.02, p = .043. Diurnal cortisol was unrelated to within-person fluctuations in LGBT and general stressors. Conclusions: Results imply that the experience of everyday minority stressors is uniquely related to diurnal cortisol and may have implications for the mental and physical health of LGBT adults.

Such stressors influence the secretion of health-relevant hormones, including cortisol, yet how dimensions of disclosure (i.e., the degree and context) influence neuroendocrine functioning remains poorly understood. The current study examined the association between disclosure context (disclosure to family members, friends/co-workers/acquaintances, and members of religious groups) and diurnal cortisol while allowing disclosure to vary in degree (i.e., how much is disclosed). Methods One hundred twenty-one sexual minority young adults (aged 18-35 years, 54.5% female, free of major psychiatric/endocrine disorders) completed an initial survey that assessed the degree and context of sexual minority identity disclosure. A randomly selected subset (n = 58) also provided salivary cortisol samples at wake, 45 minutes after wake, 12 hours after wake, and at bedtime for 1 week. Results Greater total disclosure and greater disclosure to family members were associated with reduced cortisol output, defined as Area Under the Curve relative to ground (AUCg; F(1,230) = 5.95, p =.015, and F(1,231) = 10.90, p =.001, respectively). Disclosure to co-workers, friends, acquaintances, or religious groups was unrelated to cortisol AUCg. All disclosure contexts tested were unrelated to the shape of diurnal cortisol slopes (including the cortisol awakening response).

Rumination, or mental rehearsal of past stressors, may alter the body’s stress-responsive systems by amplifying and prolonging exposure to physiological mediators, such as cortisol. The primary aim of the current investigation was to test the extent to which the tendency to ruminate on stress predicts diminished diurnal cortisol recovery (i.e., elevated evening cortisol) in a sample of sexual and gender minority young adults. Participants included 58 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender young adults (Mage = 25.0, SD = 4.1) who completed an initial online survey that assessed trait rumination and current depressed mood. Participants completed daily evening questionnaires and provided salivary cortisol samples at wake, 45 min post-wake, 12 h post-wake, and at bedtime over seven consecutive days. Trait rumination predicted significantly higher cortisol concentrations at bedtime, but was unrelated to other cortisol indices (e.g., morning cortisol, diurnal slope, total output). The association with trait rumination was not accounted for by daily negative affect, and was largely independent of depressed mood. These results have implications for identifying and treating those who may be at risk for impaired diurnal cortisol recovery and associated negative health outcomes.",Cortisol | Depressed mood | Recovery | Rumination | Sexual and gender minority | Stress,10,1,repositoryam,Green,NIH,T32DE014320,National Institutes of Health,57199372790,Ryan C.

We seek to understand these workload demands through examining the literature in major content areas of human-robot interaction. As research on HRI continues to explore a host of issues with operator workload, there is a need to synthesize the extant literature to determine its current state and to guide future research. Within HRI socio-technical systems, we reviewed the empirical literature on operator information processing and action execution. Using multiple resource theory (MRT; Wickens, 2002) as a guiding framework, we organized this review by the operator perceptual and responding demands which are routinely manipulated in HRI studies. We also reviewed the utility of different interventions for reducing the strain on the perceptual system (e.g., multimodal displays) and responses (e.g., automation). Our synthesis of the literature demonstrates that much is known about how to decrease operator workload, but there are specific gaps in knowledge due to study operations and methodology. This work furthers our understanding of workload in complex environments such as those found when working with robots.

These studies indicate that European and Asia-Pacific business schools and their faculty members are helping to lead this transition. Aims: This study examines whether U.S. dominance of IB research has truly reached its end, or whether the extent of this transition to non-U.S. authors and institutions has been overstated. To the extent that U.S. hegemony has declined, this study examines what strategies may have assisted non-U.S. nations and their business schools to emerge as leaders in producing IB research. Materials & Methods: This study employs an in-depth, time-series analysis of the evolution of IB research over a 45-year period, 1976–2020, to examine trends in institutional and national productivity globally. Results: Despite declines in overall dominance of U.S. authors and institutions, the extent varies by type of journal and U.S. impact remains profound through Ph.D. training and collaboration.

Firms in weak institutional environments often obtain certifications to appeal to foreign audiences. But these audiences hold negative evaluations of firms from weak institutional settings, judging them as being of poor quality due to their geographic origin. We argue that these negative evaluations greatly diminish the informational value of certifications, such that the costs of certification exceed revenue gains causing performance decline. We also examine whether industry-level evaluations can challenge country-level ones. Focusing on industry legitimation, we argue that this increases the salience of the industry over the institutional context. Audiences see the industry first, not the weak institutional environment. Thus, third-party certifications can become a basis for differentiating among firms and thereby help improve firm performance as industry legitimation increases. We use the first decade post-liberalization of the Indian software industry, 1992–2003, to test our hypotheses. Based on a sample of 792 firms, we find support for our arguments suggesting that in weak institutional environments certification alone is not enough for firms targeting foreign audiences to overcome the stigma of their origins; it needs to be accompanied by positive industry-level processes.",Country of origin | India | Industry legitimacy | ISO 9000 | Software industry | Stereotype bias | Third-party certifications | Weak institutional environment,10,0,,,,undefined,,15020870900,Grigorios Livanis,Grigorios,Livanis,Tenure,Associate Professor,Management Faculty,,15020870900,Journal of International Management,1075-4253,Top,,,2019-2020

In particular, it examines how economic and cultural attributes of the supplier’s host nation shape these choices and identifies whether these attributes have a substitutive, complementary, or competing relationship. Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative study was performed using data collected from 235 managers in Saudi Arabia, which has relatively homogeneous managerial population with a clear significant cultural attribute and so presents an ideal setting to study the theory developed in this paper. Data were analyzed using a repeated-measures analysis of variance and a repeated-measures and doubly multivariate analysis of variance. Findings – Building on signaling theory, it is shown that buyers from developing countries prefer suppliers from developed rather than culturally distant developing economies as stronger institutions in developed nations increase the credibility of firms. It is also shown that they prefer suppliers from developing countries that share a common cultural attribute such as religion over other developing countries, supporting social identification behavior and a substitutive relationship between cultural and economic attributes. Finally, they are indifferent between suppliers located in a developed and in a culturally similar developing country, even when the cost of obtaining the service is the same in both countries. In such cases, economic and cultural COO attributes have a competing relationship in provider selection. Research limitations/implications – It would be interesting to examine if the results of the current study extend to cultural attributes/cues other than religion that may shrink the social distance between buyers and suppliers. Practical implications – Service multinationals from developing countries may struggle to establish credibility in the eyes of potential customers, who consistently evaluate them lower than firms in developed markets or firms from developing countries that share a common social trait with the potential customers. They can compensate for this by adopting policies that enhance pre-contract trust, invest in homogeneity capital that decreases the social distance between the two firms, or by focussing their sales efforts on countries with which they share a social/cultural attribute. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the marketing and international business literatures by providing insights on how firms from developing countries can effectively compete in the global marketplace given COO effects. Overall, the results provide novel evidence of the importance of co-membership in transnational communities (for instance, religious groups across countries) in supplier selection and its relationship to economic attributes.",Country-of-origin | Outsourcing | Religion | Signalling theory,8,0,,,KAU,DSR/10/120/1433,King Abdulaziz University,15020870900,Grigorios Livanis,Grigorios,Livanis,Tenure,Associate Professor,Management Faculty,,15020870900,International Marketing Review,0265-1335,Top,,,2015-2016

Existing literature argues that technological leaders experience net knowledge outflows and are therefore losers in agglomerations. However, we do not know if they avoid locations with laggards more so than locations with leaders or vice versa, thus we examine how the relative presence of each affects leaders' location decisions. For technologically lagging firms, we argue they will prefer locations with leaders over locations with laggards. We further posit that an increasing presence of foreign firms will have a particularly detrimental effect on technologically leading domestic firms, as these lose out in the contest for talent. Contextualized in an emerging market with weak intellectual property rights protection, we examine whether these concerns about knowledge spillovers and competition for talent prompt firms to close their R&D facilities or remain open. Using 5798 observations of R&D laboratories in India during 2003-2011, we find that while technologically leading firms are more likely to close their R&D facilities as the presence of other domestic labs increases, laggards are less likely to do so. These findings suggest concerns over knowledge spillovers are present, especially on the part of technologically leading firms. Moreover, leaders are more concerned by the presence of other leaders. Technologically lagging firms, by contrast, are less likely to close R&D facilities in the face of these concerns and will prefer staying near leaders over laggards.

However, as domestic firms are trying to upgrade their capabilities, or ""catch up,"" they may also prefer locations with other firms, as these locations have knowledge spillover potential. We develop competing hypotheses to test the extent to which catch-up motivations affect location decisions. Examining the location choices of 501 domestic and 68 foreign firms for their R&D laboratories in India during 2005-2010, we find that domestic firms exhibit a stronger preference for cities with high agglomeration than foreign firms do.

Although offshoring and outsourcing have been studied from a transactional perspective, the moral issues embedded within these decisions can profoundly affect how the organization is perceived by outside stakeholders. First, we contend that investors use different moral paradigms compared with consumer stakeholders, as a result the stakeholder role an individual occupies significantly influences their ethical evaluation of offshoring and outsourcing decisions. Next, we examine whether embedded issues of product quality and information security increase the moral intensity of offshoring and outsourcing decisions, thereby negatively influencing ethical evaluations. Using vignettes, we find that respondents viewed either offshoring or outsourcing less favorably than relocation. Surprisingly, respondents viewed offshoring with data security risks more negatively than offshore outsourcing with quality risks, suggesting that the issue of information security has a greater moral intensity than the issue of product or service quality for both consumer and investor stakeholders.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study analyzing the records of all patients with type 2 DM who were admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital for lower gastrointestinal tract surgery between January 1, 2001, and May 1, 2008. We defined statin exposure as the filling of at least 1 prescription of statins during the 6 months before hospitalization or during the current hospital stay. The primary outcome was a culture positive for Candida species during hospitalization. Clinical information on a wide range of covariates was collected. Logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for possible confounders. RESULTS: Of the 1019 patients who were eligible for the study, 493 (48%) were receiving statins. A total of 139 patients (14%) had at least 1 culture positive for Candida species during hospitalization. An adjusted multivariate model based on a backward stepwise elimination procedure showed that statin therapy significantly decreased the incidence of cultures positive for Candida species (odds ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.96; P=.03) with a statistically significant prolonged time to event compared with no statin therapy (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44-0.88; P=.01).

This capacity issue has led to understaffing in some hospital areas. The purpose of this paper is to examine the understaffing in hospital-unit respiratory care and the impact to error rates, specifically missed treatments rates. The moderating effects of teamwork and standardized, integrated information systems are also considered. Design/methodology/approach: Survey methodology is used for data collection of respiratory care managers within hospital units. Regression is used to test the hypotheses in this study. Findings: The regression results show that higher rates of understaffing are associated with more missed treatments. In addition, both teamwork and integrated information systems are associated with lower missed treatments. Finally, the moderating effect of teamwork is also highly significant within the model while integrated information systems are not a significant moderator. Practical implications: Managers working within understaffed hospital units can try to reduce missed treatment rates by both integrated information systems and teamwork among employees. Additional benefits can be gained from teamwork due to the indirect effects (moderating effects) as well. This indicates teamwork training can be useful for quality initiatives. Originality/value: Understaffing is associated with higher missed treatments in hospital units. Standardized, integrated information systems within a hospital are associated with less missed treatments. Furthermore, employee teamwork within a hospital unit is associated with a direct effect on missed treatment rates as well as an indirect effect by weakening the negative impact of understaffing.",Healthcare | Hospital units | Information systems | Medical staffing | Teamwork | Understaffing,8,0,,,,undefined,,56323486000,Ashley Metcalf,Ashley,Metcalf,Tenure,Associate Professor,Management Faculty,,56323486000,,,,,,2018-2019

We consider the extent to which both pollution performance and the pollution dispersion pathway influence idiosyncratic risk for U.S. firms. Our findings suggest that the quantity of pollution alone has no direct impact on a firm's idiosyncratic risk, but that the type of pollution and its degree of human exposure, which we term 'environmental risk', highly influences idiosyncratic risk.

METHODS: Four-hundred eighty-one RTs at 44 hospitals responded to an online survey regarding job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and job stress. Random coefficient modeling was used for analysis and to account for the nested structure of the data. RESULTS: Higher levels of RT protocol use were associated with higher levels of job satisfaction, lower rates of turnover intentions, and lower levels of job stress. In addition, RTs with greater experience had higher levels of job satisfaction, and RTs working at teaching hospitals had lower rates of turnover intentions.

In addition, we assess supply chain disruption risk from three perspectives: the inbound material flow from the supplier (supply side), the internal production processes (internal), and the outbound material flow to the customer (customer side) as a disruption can occur at any of these locations. We measure disruption risk in terms of stoppages in flows, reductions in flow, close calls (disruptions that were prevented at the last minute), disruption duration (time until normal operation flow was restored), and the spread of disruptions all the way through the supply chain. We use seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) to analyze our data, finding that lead times, especially supply side lead times, are significantly associated with higher levels of supply chain disruption risk.

RESULTS: Of the 9 types of respiratory care protocols assessed (ie, asthma, COPD, ARDS, hypoxemia, pneumonia, noninvasive ventilation therapy, supplemental oxygen titration and discontinuation, ventilator weaning, and bronchopulmonary hygiene), the most commonly used were for oxygen titration and ventilator weaning. Large hospitals (> 350 beds) used protocols more widely than smaller hospitals (P =.01). Respondents felt that use of protocols enhanced cost and quality of care.

The literature shows that there are gaps in the financing of academic and graduate ventures. The second part of the chapter introduces short case examples that illustrate different forms of university-led venture funding, demonstrating how different universities have sought to fill funding gaps by means of seed capital grants, micro-financing, small business research grants, crowdfunding, social impact investing, seed capital investing, public venture capital, and venture capital.

Despite the interest, previous work has focused on entrepreneurial ecosystems in large cities in the United States. Ecosystems in small cities, underpopulated rural areas, university towns and outside the USA have not been considered much. This paper begins to address this deficit by reviewing three groups of literature. Design/methodology/approach: From the review, the paper builds a conceptual framework to consider entrepreneurial ecosystems led by universities. After summarizing the literature on entrepreneurial ecosystems, entrepreneurial universities and entrepreneurship education, the paper suggests a conceptual framework outlying the structure, components and mechanisms that enable universities to operate as catalysts in the creation of entrepreneurial ecosystems. Findings: It is evident that on many of the “ingredients” of a successful entrepreneurial ecosystem, a resource-constrained environment would have many gaps. Building an entrepreneurship ecosystem in such contexts would be inherently challenging. The model presented suggests that the presence of a university in such locations should enhance the prospects of progress but that the nature of the university itself would impact any outcomes. Universities that make concerted efforts to be entrepreneurial and that have entrepreneurship programmes have strategies available to them that can enhance entrepreneurship ecosystems over time. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is to show “how” a university and its entrepreneurship programme can operationally address deficits in a local ecosystem and how it might bring about positive change. The paper also opens new avenues for entrepreneurship education researchers.",Entrepreneurial ecosystem | Entrepreneurial university | Entrepreneurship education | Higher education | Student entrepreneurship,15,0,,,ESF,EFOP-3.6.2-16-2017-00017,European Social Fund,12767012500,Luke Pittaway,Luke,Pittaway,Tenure,Professor,Management Faculty,0000-0002-7545-9030,12767012500,,,,,,2020-2021

It identifies characteristics that make a space conducive to innovation and explains whether current spaces adequately conform to those characteristics. More generally, this paper seeks to clarify what is being built, for which purposes and with what results. Design/methodology/approach: Given the novelty of this research, the paper uses a multiple-method approach to allow for an iterative examination between theory and data. Multiple data and methods were used, including an action research method, a systematic survey of 57 entrepreneurship spaces at US universities and a thematic and content analyses of interviews carried out with individuals directly involved in the functioning of such spaces. Findings: The paper presents a prescriptive model aimed at guiding the practitioner in the design of an entrepreneurship space. It identifies five types of entrepreneurship spaces that differentially support entrepreneurial activities and rely on different characteristics. These characteristics are centrally important for innovation and entrepreneurship spaces. Practical implications: There are a number of practical implications from the work. It identifies key challenges in the design of entrepreneurship spaces and shows which questions to consider in the decision-making process. Originality/value: The paper advances research on entrepreneurship spaces, an important yet poorly understood phenomenon.

Economic theories have made significant contributions and are one of the historical roots of the subject (Bygrave, 1989). Despite these contributions the concept of the ‘entrepreneur’ and the function of entrepreneurship in society have ranged extensively within theories (Hébert and Link, 1988). Previous categorisations have shown that the ‘entrepreneur’ has been viewed as a class of economic actor, a capitalist, a manager, an owner, an arbitrageur, an innovator and the bearer of uncertainty (Binks and Vale, 1990). These early theories of entrepreneurship continue to have a profound affect on the meaning of ‘entrepreneurship’ within contemporary society and consequently influence current debate in the subject (Kirchhoff, 1991). Although previous research has explored many of the differences between economic theories contributing to our understanding there is only limited prior work on the philosophical basis of these differences (Barreto, 1989). The purpose of the chapter is to explore these ‘taken for granted’ assumptions explaining some of the fundamental differences that exist in key conceptions of the ‘entrepreneur’. Understanding these differences is important because it helps us recognise the factors which influence policy interventions designed to promote ‘entrepreneurship’ and ‘enterprise’.",,0,0,,,,undefined,,12767012500,Luke Pittaway,Luke,Pittaway,Tenure,Professor,Management Faculty,0000-0002-7545-9030,12767012500,,,,,,2016-2017

These latter conceptions have influenced teaching practice as well as students’ normative perceptions regarding learning expectations and organizational design in educational institutions.

The primary focus of this paper is on learning transfer and factors affecting it, arguing that entrepreneurs must engage in 'action' in order to 'learn' and that under certain conditions they may transfer learning to their firm. This paper draws on data from 19 focus groups undertaken from 2010 to 2012, involving 51 participants in the LEAD Wales programme. It considers the literatures exploring learning transfer and develops a conceptual framework, outlining four areas of focus for entrepreneurial learning. Utilising thematic analysis, it describes and evaluates what (actual facts and information) and how (techniques, styles of learning) participants transfer and what actions they take to improve the business and develop their people. This paper illustrates the complex mechanisms involved in this process and concludes that action learning is a method of facilitating entrepreneurial learning which is able to help address some of the problems of engagement, relevance and value that have been highlighted previously. This paper concludes that the efficacy of an entrepreneurial learning intervention in SMEs may depend on the effectiveness of learning transfer. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",action learning | entrepreneurial learning | learning transfer | SMEs,12,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,12767012500,Luke Pittaway,Luke,Pittaway,Tenure,Professor,Management Faculty,0000-0002-7545-9030,12767012500,,,,,,2013-2014

It begins with a biography of Cope, which summarizes his academic life and offers a timeline for his publications. This paper then explores his philosophical position, before dividing his research into three main phases. In the first, it examines and explains his early work into experiential learning; reflective learning; learning from crises and the role social influences play in entrepreneurial learning. In the second, developments stemming from his PhD are explored. Here, ideas in relation to entrepreneurial learning and the links he makes to transformative learning and double-loop learning are discussed. Finally, in the third part, Cope's entrepreneurial learning framework is explained and key contributing concepts are introduced. This part examines how Cope's theoretical framework was used to undertake research and subsequently to explain how entrepreneurs learn from failure. In the final sections of this paper, the practical implications of his contribution to entrepreneurship education are presented, in the contexts both of higher education and of the development of students, and then for entrepreneurs themselves. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",entrepreneurial learning | entrepreneurship education | failure | Jason Cope,130,0,,,,undefined,,12767012500,Luke Pittaway,Luke,Pittaway,Tenure,Professor,Management Faculty,0000-0002-7545-9030,12767012500,Entrepreneurship & Regional Development,0898-5626,High Quality,,,2012-2013

Design/methodology/approach: This paper introduces general assessment practice issues and highlights key considerations. It explains prior research on assessment practice in entrepreneurship education and argues that there is too little empirical research on the subject. Finally, it outlines a typology of entrepreneurship education that highlights variation between different: forms; learning outcomes; subjects; and, possible methods of assessment practice. The methodology for the study gathers data from course outlines (syllabi) and explains how these were collected and analysed. Findings: The results show that educational practice in entrepreneurship education continues to be dominated by the ""About"" form and highlight that there are different cultures of assessment practice in the UK and the USA. The paper finds compelling evidence that different forms are using assessment in different ways. Research limitations/implications: This paper identifies that there have been few studies exploring assessment practice in entrepreneurship education and argues that further research is required in this area. It also highlights a need for a focus on assessment practice in disciplines beyond the business school. The work demonstrates that further research could explore other stakeholders in the assessment process and seek to understand how these external assessors affect student learning. Practical implications: In conclusion, the paper highlights that assessment generally needs to become more innovative, more reflective in nature and include more stakeholders in the process. Originality/value: Understanding is enhanced because the paper explores what entrepreneurship educators actually ""do"" when they assess entrepreneurship education and, therefore, the research moves beyond prescriptive accounts and provides a detailed understanding of actual practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Assessment | Assessment practice | Curricula | Education | Entrepreneurship education | Student assessment | Students | Typology of entrepreneurship education | United Kingdom | United States of America,207,0,,,,undefined,,12767012500,Luke Pittaway,Luke,Pittaway,Tenure,Professor,Management Faculty,0000-0002-7545-9030,12767012500,,,,,,2012-2013

Data from 10 unstructured interviews, a series of telephone interviews and an e-mail postcard are reported. The results show that students' motivations for engaging in clubs vary and that they differ between different types of clubs. In terms of entrepreneurial learning students' engagement in clubs and societies provides enhanced opportunities for 'learning by doing' through action and experience. The data show that increased action leads to reflective practice and that social learning is important.

The review was undertaken as part of the Economic and Social Research Council's Evolution of Business Knowledge Programme. The paper describes the systematic review protocol and provides a detailed explanation of the methods used. From the review, it is evident that SME knowledge research concentrates primarily on the acquisition and use of knowledge, treating it as an asset that is transferred by routines. The findings suggest that research is focused in three main areas. First, on the influence and abilities of the entrepreneur to extract, use and develop knowledge resources. Secondly, on firm-wide systems and the social capital that facilitates knowledge exploration and exploitation. Thirdly, on the provision of knowledge and learning experiences through government policy. From a practical perspective, the review concludes that policies encouraging entrepreneurship and economic regeneration need to be more flexible and sensitive to the often complex contexts within which knowledge is used by SMEs. From a research perspective, and given the flexible, opportunity-oriented and often novel nature of SMEs identified in these studies, there is a need to consider the relational and embedded qualities of knowledge by which these characteristics are framed; qualities that resist conceptualization as some form of separable, material asset. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.",,529,0,,,,undefined,,12767012500,Luke Pittaway,Luke,Pittaway,Tenure,Professor,Management Faculty,0000-0002-7545-9030,12767012500,International Journal of Management Reviews,1460-8545,Top,,,2005-2006

The research highlighted some interesting results and perception gaps and this article will present these results. Micro-business owners, for example, believed that their businesses were not appropriate for graduate employment and that they could not utilize graduate skills. As firms grew, however, their readiness to recruit graduates increased and owner-managers who had professional qualifications were also more likely to recruit graduates. The study indicated that smaller firms placed greater emphasis on the ability of the graduates to 'fit' within the business and findings suggested that SMEs expected graduates to be able to perform and contribute immediately.

Design/methodology/approach - A range of historical studies is reviewed that examine entrepreneurship from an economic perspective. A framework of social science research paradigms is used to categorise these approaches according to their philosophical assumptions. Findings - The paper finds that certain philosophies can harm the development of theory and that study using a wider range could help improve the value of research. Originality/value - This paper fills an identified gap in philosophical discussions by exploring the economic theories. In doing so, it provides a structured approach to understanding some of the differences that underlie economic policy supporting the promotion of enterprise. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Economic theory | Entrepreneurialism | Philosophy,70,0,,,,undefined,,12767012500,Luke Pittaway,Luke,Pittaway,Tenure,Professor,Management Faculty,0000-0002-7545-9030,12767012500,International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behavior & Research,1355-2554,High Quality,,,2004-2005

Until recently, insights into the dynamics of this relationship have been fragmented. This paper presents a systematic review of research linking the networking behaviour of firms with their innovative capacity. We find that the principal benefits of networking as identified in the literature include: risk sharing; obtaining access to new markets and technologies; speeding products to market; pooling complementary skills; safeguarding property rights when complete or contingent contracts are not possible; and acting as a key vehicle for obtaining access to external knowledge. The evidence also illustrates that those firms which do not co-operate and which do not formally or informally exchange knowledge limit their knowledge base long term and ultimately reduce their ability to enter into exchange relationships. At an institutional level, national systems of innovation play an important role in the diffusion of innovations in terms of the way in which they shape networking activity. The paper provides evidence suggesting that network relationships with suppliers, customers and intermediaries such as professional and trade associations are important factors affecting innovation performance and productivity. Where networks fail, it is due to inter-firm conflict, displacement, lack of scale, external disruption and lack of infrastructure. The review identifies several gaps in the literature that need to be filled. For instance, there is a need for further exploration of the relationship between networking and different forms of innovation, such as process and organisational innovation. Similarly, we need better understanding of network dynamics and network configurations, as well as the role of third parties such as professional and trade associations. Our study highlights the need for interdisciplinary research in these areas.",,1162,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,,12767012500,Luke Pittaway,Luke,Pittaway,Tenure,Professor,Management Faculty,0000-0002-7545-9030,12767012500,International Journal of Management Reviews,1460-8545,Top,,,2004-2005

Specifically, we examine the theoretical mechanisms explaining a positive relationship between number of temporary teams and turnover decisions. In Study 1, we surprisingly found that number of temporary teams negatively related to turnover decisions through MTM identity strain with permanent team identification strengthening this effect. In contrast, in Study 2, we found support for the hypothesized relationships: number of teams indirectly positively related to turnover intentions, mediated by MTM identity strain and cognitive depletion, and permanent team identification weakened the indirect effect.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from top managers in 231 Belgian business-to-business service firms crossing a broad spectrum of industries. The statistical techniques employed included a confirmatory factor analysis, and hierarchical regression analyses. Findings - The findings of the study suggest that technical infrastructure and external drivers influence e-business implementation. Additionally, e-business was found to create value for firms through efficiency, novelty, lock-in, and complementarities. Research limitations/implications - The results imply that a firm's behavior, while driven in part by external factors (e.g. shareholders, competitors, customers, etc.), is largely contingent upon a firm's internal infrastructure and environment. It should be noted that only the firm side of the dyadic relationships was surveyed and examined. Practical implications - Managers should assess a firm's technological infrastructure before launching an e-business venture. Also, since firms believe that implementing e-business has positive outcomes that extend beyond firm performance, it can be logically posited that these value drivers will positively influence a firm's overall performance.

The focus is on how employees' citizenship identities shape extra-role behaviors which include both organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) and contextual performance behaviors (CPBs). Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses role identity theory as the theoretical lens to develop the model of extra-role behaviors, distinguishing between OCBs and CPBs. Findings – While extra-role behaviors are generally associated with positive organizational functioning, these behaviors also have been linked to negative individual outcomes, such as work-family conflict, role overload, and reduced task performance. Based on previous research and theory, a conceptual model is developed that explains when extra-role behaviors will occur, when and why these behaviors will be internalized as an identity, and how identities affect whether employees engage in OCBs or CPBs. Further, the paper examines the influence of these extra-role behaviors on long term positive and negative outcomes. Research limitations/implications – The main research implication of this paper is the use of role identity theory to further understanding of the nature of extra-role behaviors. Originality/value – The paper aims to offer a comprehensive theoretically based model to explain OCBs and incorporates research conducted to date to develop the model. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Employee turnover | Organizational behaviour | Work identity,25,0,,,,undefined,,7004843552,Jason Stoner,Jason,Stoner,Tenure,Associate Professor,Management Faculty,,7004843552,,,,,,2010-2011

Unexpectedly, it was found that individuals negotiating via instant messaging were more satisfied with the negotiation process than were face-to-face negotiators. Finally, results supported the hypothesis that those being deceptive about hidden agendas experienced higher tension than those without hidden agendas. These findings have several implications for organizations: higher levels of tension from computer-mediated negotiations and from deception can affect the long-term effectiveness of employees, undetected deception in computer-mediated negotiations can have a negative impact on negotiations, and computer-mediation can lead to the use of a forcing negotiation style, which may improve the effectiveness of negotiators with individualistic goals. © 2007 International Communication Association.",,35,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,,7004843552,Jason Stoner,Jason,Stoner,Tenure,Associate Professor,Management Faculty,,7004843552,,,,,,2006-2007

However, theoretical understanding of why this relationship exists is lacking. Addressing this gap in the literature, this research proposes a theoretical model of the relationship between individualism-collectivism and team performance by integrating two previously distinct theories, social identity theory and the social relations model. Drawing upon these theories, we propose that team identification, meta-perception accuracy, and team identity will mediate the relationship between individualism-collectivism and team performance. Further, we posit that task interdependence will moderate the relationship between individualism- collectivism and team identifi-cation. In developing our work, we formulate testable propositions which are aligned with the specific relationships shown in our model.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews the self-regulation literature and regulatory-focus theory in particular, and integrates this literature within the strategic leadership and organizational change literatures to present a dispositional model with propositions about the relationships between these literatures. Findings - Strategic leadership of organizational change should allow for co-existent states of both continuity and change. Leadership teams should include a mix of individuals with promotion and prevention foci of self-regulation and should provide for a regulatory fit that cascades throughout the organization. Practical implications - Leaders should increase their self-awareness of promotion and prevention styles of self-regulation and rely on a mix of individuals that increase the chances of valuing and enhancing both continuity and change in their organizations.

According to regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997), promotion focus concerns with accomplishments and aspirations produce strategic eagerness whereas prevention focus concerns with safety and responsibilities produce strategic vigilance. Studies 1-3 show faster performance and less accuracy in simple drawing tasks for participants with a chronic or situationally induced promotion focus compared to participants with a prevention focus. These studies also show that as participants move closer to the goal of completing the task, speed increases and accuracy decreases for participants with a promotion focus, whereas speed decreases and accuracy increases for participants with a prevention focus. Study 4 basically replicates these results for situationally induced regulatory focus with a more complex proofreading task. The study found that a promotion focus led to faster proofreading compared to a prevention focus, whereas a prevention focus led to higher accuracy in finding more difficult errors than a promotion focus. Through speed and searching for easy errors, promotion focus participants maximized their proofreading performance. In all four studies, the speed effects were independent of the accuracy effects and vice versa.

By distinguishing between promotion pride and prevention pride, the present paper extends this classic model of achievement motivation. Regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997) distinguishes between a promotion focus on hopes and accomplishments (gains) and a prevention focus on safety and responsibilities (non-losses). We propose that a subjective history of success with promotion-related eagerness (promotion pride) orients individuals toward using eagerness means to approach a new task goal, whereas a subjective history of success with prevention-related vigilance (prevention pride) orients individuals toward using vigilance means to approach a new task goal. Studies 1-3 tested this proposal by examining the relations between a new measure of participants' subjective histories of promotion success and prevention success (the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (RFQ)) and their achievement strategies in different tasks. Study 4 examined the relation between participants' RFQ responses and their reported frequency of feeling eager or vigilant in past task engagements. Study 5 used an experimental priming technique to make participants temporarily experience either a subjective history of promotion success or a subjective history of prevention success. For both chronic and situationally induced achievement pride, these studies found that when approaching task goals individuals with promotion pride use eagerness means whereas individuals with prevention pride use vigilance means.

While extant work has investigated the impact of policing, or guardianship, for customers and firms, there has been limited examination regarding the policies themselves and the corresponding toll exacted upon frontline employees (FLEs) and their managers (FLMs). Thus, this phenomenon warranted an in-depth, multi-method investigation, including a full-scale qualitative exploration substantiated and extended via three experiments and a survey. The qualitative approach probes employees’ feelings about and identifies categories of CDB in retail service settings as well as develops a novel typology of guardianship policies (policy type x approach style). The subsequent studies empirically test the CDB guardianship typology in the context of a particularly detrimental type of CDB—shoplifting, while advancing understanding of firm-related (guardianship expectations), employee-related (trait anxiety) and job role-related (FLE vs FLM) contextual factors impacting perceptions of policy fairness and turnover intentions.

Research on deviant behaviors exhibited by consumers covers topics ranging from showrooming to shoplifting. Shoplifting can be a tremendous burden on retailers’ bottom lines. While FLEs have traditionally served customers, the role of these employees has evolved and expanded to include monitoring and enforcement of customers’ deviant behaviors. Thus, the role of FLEs has evolved into not only serving customers, but also to policing customer compliance. While academic studies have proposed the use of FLEs to help reduce deviant behavior, and despite acknowledgement of academia’s limited insights on the relationship between employee guardianship and organizational commitment (Potdar, Garry, Guthrie, and Gnoth 2019, p 77), little is known about the impact of using FLEs in a guardianship capacity. Thus, the current work seeks to better understand the mechanisms and outcomes of expecting FLEs to act as guardians against consumers’ deviant behaviors, in our case shoplifting. The present study draws on appraisal theory of emotions and equity theory to investigate the impact of retailers’ customer deviant behavior policies on FLEs. Three experiments shed light on the phenomenon. Study 1 demonstrates that the addition of guardianship responsibilities to FLE duties incites anger and reduces perceptions of employee policy fairness. Study 2 expands on these findings and explores how guardianship policy elements, such as permitting vs. requiring FLEs to confront shoplifters, affect employee perceptions of the policy. Specifically, study 2 examines the role of empowerment in explaining feelings of anger and policy fairness perceptions and introduces social implications of customer (bystander) relationships. The results demonstrate the adverse effects of requiring FLEs to engage shoplifters are exacerbated in the presence of loyal (vs. transactional) customers. Study 3 explores additional policy elements such as prohibiting FLEs from approaching suspected shoplifters. This study demonstrates that as FLEs’ job role anxiety increases, policy fairness perceptions become less favorable. Additionally, Study 3 expands on the previous studies by extending the phenomenon to include more managerially relevant employee responses in the form of turnover intentions. Across three experiments and multiple settings, we generally establish the negative effect of guardianship behavior, in our case the shoplifting policies on FLEs attitudes and job behaviors. We also identify how and when deviant behavior policy requirements can affect outcomes such as perceptions of policy fairness and employee turnover intentions.",Deviant behavior | Frontline employees | Policy fairness | Turnover intentions,0,0,,,,undefined,,55324932500,"James ""Mick"" Andzulis",James,Andzulis,Tenure,Associate Professor,Marketing Faculty,0000-0002-0752-3248,55324932500,,,,,,2021-2022

Beginning with the role of computers to laptops, moving to the influence of the Internet, onward to customer relationship management and sales force automation applications, and now to the role of social media, sales research is being shuttled into a new technological paradigm. The purpose of this paper is to review the role of social media in the sales force and the sales process. We begin the paper by providing definitions of social media and reviewing the role and importance of social media in business. An analogy between the rise of Internet usage in the sales force and the advent of social media is presented and discussed. Next, we discuss the challenges of social media in the sales and marketing interface and review four different business strategies to determine who ""owns"" social media within an organization. We continue with a discussion of the different stages in the sales process and offer ways in which social media influences each individual step, thereby outlining future research opportunities. © 2012 PSE National Educational Foundation.

Despite a certain level of innateness, soft skills can be taught, as evidenced by the countless courses on LinkedIn Learning and Udemy. In a survey of business executives, soft skill attributes included communication, courtesy, flexibility, integrity, interpersonal skills, attitude, professionalism, responsibility, teamwork, and work ethic (Robles 2012).

Yet, not all doctoral programs in marketing offer a course on theory, and those that do vary greatly in their coverage of this essential topic. Little guidance exists on how, exactly, marketing educators can go about this task. Providing guidance on the instruction of marketing theory is the central goal of this paper. Specifically, the questions this paper aims to address are: Why is theory, and marketing theory in particular, so difficult to understand? How can marketing teachers effectively convey instruction on the topic of theory in marketing? How do marketing students know whether they have generated a theoretical contribution? The purpose of this paper is to elucidate what, exactly, a theoretical contribution in marketing is, and to offer practical advice for marketing educators on how to instruct aspiring scholars on this important topic. The challenges in understanding and developing theoretical contributions are noted by scholars in many disciplines. In addition to the typical challenges related to theory that scholars in all disciplines face, marketing as a discipline faces additional challenges that make contributing to theory in especially difficult. Despite these challenges, the discipline of marketing has produced a number of seminal theoretical contributions. To illustrate, we examine three examples of work that have advanced marketing theory and are particularly effective in conveying their theoretical contributions. These include: Price, Arnould, and Tierney’s 1995 paper on service encounters, the work of Kerin, Varadarajan, and Peterson (1992) on first mover competitive advantage, and Gaski’s (1984) paper on power and conflict in marketing distribution channels. This paper provides guidelines for educators regarding instruction of these complicated topics. These guidelines provide a resource that marketing educators can consult when developing courses or course modules on theory. Ultimately, we hope that this article will not only help marketing educators and students to better understand what reviewers are looking for and thus increase the likelihood of their article being accepted and published by an academic marketing journal but will also help authors to craft significant contributions that will enhance current marketing thinking.",Doctoral education | Marketing education | Theoretical contributions | Theory,0,0,,,,undefined,,56845542600,Rebecca Dingus,Rebecca,Dingus,Tenure,Associate Professor,Marketing Faculty,,56845542600,,,,,,2019-2020

A comprehensive summary of common brand constructs (e.g. brand identification, brand attachment) is employed and supplemented with a social network analysis. To encourage more research in the salesperson-brand domain, we then summarize common themes that pervade the literature and identify a plethora of future opportunities in both established domains (e.g. brand relationships increase effort) and new frontiers (e.g. exploring the dark side of salespeople-brand relationships).",Brand | brand attachment | brand identification | review | salesperson,0,0,,,,undefined,,57226375393,Moumita Gyomlai,Moumita,Gyomlai,Tenure,Assistant Professor,Marketing Faculty,,57226375393,Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management,0885-3134,High Quality,,,2022-2023

Entering such stores entails challenges as the luxury brand steps outside its luxury environment and loses direct control of the salesperson that interacts with the end consumer. Furthermore, in a less selective non-DOS, a luxury brand’s sales may get impacted due to image discrepancies in the salesperson’s mind, while the luxury brand competes for the salesperson’s attention. This study proposes several motivational levers that direct the efforts of a salesperson in a less selective non-DOS: the salesperson’s perceived fit between the brand and the store, the level of identification with the luxury brand, and luxury sensitivity. With empirical support in a unique dataset, the authors show that a salesperson’s perceived fit increases effort allocation for a luxury brand, and luxury brand identification strengthens it. Counterintuitively, the results show that a salesperson with a high level of luxury sensitivity is not predisposed to sell luxury outside a luxury environment.

The authors posit that watching someone play can offer the same enjoyment (measured through emotional experience, mood and joy) as playing. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach was used. A qualitative phase involving semistructured qualitative interviews, naturalistic inquiry and netnography generated testable hypotheses, which were tested using a two-condition, between-subjects field experiment. Findings: This research advances the understanding of vicarious and experiential consumption by finding evidence that VC can produce the same levels of emotional experience, mood, attitude toward the product, joy, brand community loyalty and positive word of mouth. It also demonstrates the moderating effect of familiarity on mood change. Research limitations/implications: This research demonstrates evidence that VC can offer outcomes similar to active consumption (AC). The authors advance research on VC in a new context (video-game livestreaming vs esports and other contexts) and from a new perspective (viewing motivations vs consumer-oriented outcomes). This research thus presents opportunities to explore these and other affective, behavior and cognitive outcomes in other contexts. Practical implications: To reach Twitch users, marketers must understand how and why media consumers watch. This research provides insight into the community necessary to create effective advertising. Originality/value: Building upon Sjöblom and Hamari, focusing on motivations for VC of esports and other related works, the authors expand the context to video-game livestreaming as a whole and examine affective, behavioral and cognitive outcomes compared with AC.

Instead, they may consider using consumer collaboration or crowdsourcing. In fact, crowdsourced ideas are closely linked to a variety of marketing innovations. Consider Google’s recent update in India, which allows TV shows and movie reviews from web users right within Google search results (Perez 2017). However, consumers may have contradictory goals between each other. Under ideal conditions, a firm can respond to divergent consumer demand by adjusting product or service offerings accordingly. The strategy of market segmentation, then, is useful to address consumer heterogeneity (Smith 1956). The constraints some firms may face in circumstances that are less than ideal are central to our argument in the development of new products. For example, segmentation may not be a viable option when supply-side resources are constrained, market position depth is maximized, or the addition of a new segment is not profitable. Additionally, segmentation may simply fail to align with a firm’s core mission. Our research, then, addresses the conflict that occurs when segmentation does not play a strategic role in the new product development (NPD) process. Self-segregated groups of consumers are co-creatively involved in NPD but may have contradictory product goals. We explore the outcome, co-competition (Hiler et al. 2017), here. For our study, we used a grounded theory approach combined with content analysis (Corbin and Strauss 2008; Charmaz 2002). We implemented a critical incident technique survey methodology, which permitted participants to pick their own context in which to provide an example of a time they felt a company and/or service provider abandoned and/or betrayed them for another group of consumers (Flanagan 1954; Gremler 2004). Finally, the analysis of the data was conducted using a hermeneutic and phenomenological approach (Thompson et al. 1994) while also relying on models of naturalistic inquiry (Belk et al. 1988). Our research implies that co-competition negatively influences consumers’ attitude toward the company. Value propositions furnished by the firm become lopsided or diluted, and consumption levels (e.g., subscriptions, in this context) are significantly reduced. As a result, empirical examinations that experimentally test the differences in attitudes and behavioral outcomes, as a function of consumers’ varying ability levels and dispositions (proclivity) toward co-creation, would be appropriate and timely contributions to marketing research and management.

To better understand this phenomenon, this research presents a framework for understanding the consumption of video games by examining the intersection of player, narrative, and gameplay. Our findings suggest that advancements in video game technology and design have gradually increased the degree of integration among these domains.

In contrast with passive forms of escapism, whereby consumers act as observers (e.g. watching a movie), active escapism provides consumers with the opportunity to directly interact with mediated realities, whether constructed in a virtual space (e.g. a video game) or the real world. Design/methodology/approach: Within the context of video game consumption, a conceptual framework for active escapism comprised antecedents, processes and consequences is established through literature review, depth interviews and naturalistic inquiry. Findings: The findings suggest that active escapism functions as a coping mechanism when consumers are confronted with external stressors that threaten either their sense of identity or control. While other forms of emotion-focused coping relieve stress through psychological avoidance (i.e. refocusing of attention away from stressors), active escapism provides the benefits of affirmation and empowerment through projective fantasy (i.e. role-play) and presence (i.e. immersion into a mediated reality).

These retailers often follow a decentralized approach by formally involving their store managers in key decision-making processes related to the MNCs’ brands. While store managers play a key role in the success of MNCs’ brands, two key questions remain unanswered: (1) what drives a store manager’s psychological engagement with MNCs’ brands across cultures, and (2) do cultural differences matter to translating store managers’ psychological brand engagement into constructive brand voice behavior? We answer these questions using a multilevel dataset spanning nine Latin American countries/MNC subsidiaries, five data sources, and three time periods. The findings reveal that uncertainty avoidance exerts a differing moderating influence on the relationship of MNC–retailer relationship investment and the store managers' MNC brand knowledge with psychological brand engagement, whereas individualism and uncertainty avoidance positively moderate the effect of MNC’s extra-contractual incentives on store managers' psychological brand engagement. Also, psychological brand engagement takes on a more important role in leading store managers to speak up, at lower levels of long-term orientation.

Unfortunately, prior studies have paid less attention to how these technologies are affecting sales scholars’ work, such as conducting literature reviews. Our study expands the repertoire of inquiry for sales academics in the domain of AI/ML in three novel ways. First, we offer an efficient process to analyzing the sales literature, through an unsupervised ML-based process, which allows the identification of articles/topics based on semantic similarity rather than based on keywords. Second, we validate our process by applying it to scholarly work published in JPSSM as well as to the practitioner’s literature in the past 40 years.

Employees' interpretation of CSR is important because of the paradoxical nature of CSR. When firms operate in ways that seem counter to their nature (i.e., pursuit of social good rather than profit), the causal attributions of affected employees are crucial to understanding their work-related behavior, as is the role of contextual factors such as leadership processes in shaping these attributions. Drawing from attribution and social learning theories, we develop a multilevel social influence theory of how CSR affects employees. We integrate managers as second observers in the baseline actor (i.e., firm)—observer (i.e., employee) dyad, whereas most attribution theory research has focused on single actor–observer dyads. Multisource field data collected from 427 employees and 45 managers were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling. Managers' genuine (self-serving) CSR attributions are positively related to employees' genuine (self-serving) CSR attributions; and the strength of the relationship between managers' and employees' genuine CSR attributions depends on managers' organizational tenure. Employees' genuine CSR attributions also are positively related to employee advocacy, whereas—interestingly—employees' self-serving CSR attributions do not appear to harm employee advocacy.

Prior work, however, has largely taken a dyadic, interpersonal approach where leadership originating at one level (i.e., the sales leader) influences others (i.e., salespeople) thus paying no attention to the intrapersonal level whereby leadership originates within the individual with the purpose to influence oneself. Importantly, the realities of the modern sales position (e.g., self-managing teams, virtual work away from direct supervision) requires attention to other forms of leadership that may stem from and manifest at the individual level - namely, self-leadership strategies. Here we address this gap by focusing on a particular form of self-leadership - that is, thought self-leadership (TSL). We draw on social cognitive and self-regulation theories to ground hypothesis development and investigate the relationship between self-monitoring behaviors, TSL, self-efficacy, organizational-based self-esteem (OBSE), and salesperson performance. Findings from a sample of 301 salespeople in five companies demonstrate positive relationships between self-monitoring behaviors and TSL, TSL and self-efficacy, and self-efficacy and salesperson performance. Moderation analysis shows that TSL will result in higher levels of self-efficacy only when moderate to high levels of OBSE exist.

Unfortunately, knowledge to date tends to be fragmented in that prior work has followed one of the two notable conceptualizations which, however, take a different route to studying sales controls: the Oliver and Anderson (O&A) index and the Jaworski and Colleagues (J&C) measures. Consequently, important questions remain unaddressed: Does choice of sales control conceptualization matter to sales research? What is the degree of similarity between the two conceptualizations and how do they compare against measurement qualities and effects on performance? Drawing on a unique dataset that matches survey data to objective, time-lagged, firm financial performance data, we reveal that choice of sales control conceptualization matters. Surprisingly, unlike current assumptions, the O&A index, is equally related to J&C's output and process controls whereas it reflects both formal and informal types of control. Analyses show that at least some components of the O&A index are not identical to J&C's process or output controls and thus measures from each conceptualization cannot be substituted. Moreover, the size and nature of sales controls' effects on sales force performance differ depending on the conceptualization employed, thus strengthening the view that the two conceptualizations should not be used interchangeably. Finally, results reveal an intriguing pattern of nonlinear effects such as that-beyond a certain point-process (but not behavioral) control may be detrimental to customer relationship performance.

First, although sales technology represents a continuous source of change, little is known about why salespeople commit to technology-induced changes. Second, knowledge on whether sales force intelligence norms play a role into translating use of sales technology to performance gains is remarkably sparse. To address these gaps, this study develops a conceptual framework that explores the linear and non-linear effects of commitment to technological change (i.e., affective, normative, and continuance) on sales technology infusion, and, in turn, on two key outcomes (i.e., customer-oriented selling and sales performance). Our framework also advances knowledge on how sales force intelligence norms (i.e., analytical sales processes and knowledge sharing with customers) moderate the relationships between sales technology infusion and key outcomes. Analysis is done using multilevel structural equation modeling on a sample of 303 salespeople nested within 22 firms. Findings support the view that the three components of commitment are distinct, with some counter-intuitive results. Specifically, affective commitment does not exert a significant positive influence as expected; yet, normative commitment does. In contrast, while lower levels of continuance commitment reduce infusion, higher levels have positive effects, thus depicting a U-shaped effect.

As such, very few studies have focused on the micro (individual) level of analysis. Against this backdrop, the present study focuses on the individual level of analysis thereby contributing to the emerging psychology of CSR literature, which considers employees' perceptions of their employing organizations' social actions as more important than organizations' objective CSR performance (Rupp, Shao, Thornton and Skarlicki (2013), ‘Applicants’ and Employees’ Reactions to Corporate Social Responsibility: The Moderating Effects of First-Party Justice Perceptions and Moral Identity,’ Personnel Psychology, 66, 895–933). Moreover, the study is one of the first examining the role of context in employee attitudes toward CSR. In particular, it builds on the psychology of CSR (e.g. Rupp et al. 2013) literature to propose a research framework that delineates the moderating effects of satisfaction with payment, satisfaction with the job itself and individualism in the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) perceptions and customer-facing employees' behavioral outcomes. Data are collected from customer-facing employees in two major organizations in the Netherlands and India. Results suggest a complex interplay between CSP perceptions and the two facets of job satisfaction, and that national context is likely to moderate the contingent effects of CSP perceptions on customer-facing employees' behavioral outcomes.",corporate social performance | corporate social responsibility | cross-national | customer-facing employees | job satisfaction | salespeople,17,0,,,,undefined,,8215699600,Nikolaos Panagopoulos,Nikolaos,Panagopoulos,Tenure,Professor,Marketing Faculty,0000-0002-5104-2740,8215699600,Journal of International Management,1075-4253,Top,,,2014-2015

However, prior work in the area has paid little attention to how CSR initiatives should be implemented inside the organization. Against this backdrop, this study examines the impact of CSR initiatives on an important stakeholder group-employees. We build and test a comprehensive multilevel framework that focuses on whether employees derive job satisfaction from CSR programs. The proposed model predicts that a manager's charismatic leadership influences employees' interpretations about the motives underlying their companies' engagement in CSR initiatives (intrinsic and extrinsic CSR-induced attributions) which, in turn, influence employee job satisfaction. Hierarchical linear modeling of data from 47 organizational units comprising 438 employees from three world-leading manufacturing organizations shows that when employees think that their manager possesses charismatic leadership qualities, they tend to attribute the organization's motives for engaging in CSR activities to intrinsic values, which, in turn, are positively associated with job satisfaction. Also, the extent to which managers are perceived as charismatic leaders relates positively to job satisfaction. Interestingly, CSR-induced extrinsic attributions are neither explained by charismatic leadership nor do they predict job satisfaction.

The results suggest the hygiene role of values-driven CSR-induced attributions, the motivator role of consumer benevolence and the bivalent mechanisms of perceived service quality and trust. Furthermore, the study recognizes consumer trust as an important mediating mechanism through which the postulated curvilinearities affect loyalty intentions.

Yet surprisingly little research examines the role of the sales force, compared to overall firm strategies, for shaping these key processes. Against this background, this paper offers an integrative framework that delineates how the sales force creates, sustains, and appropriates value in buyer-seller relationships. The framework integrates relevant theories and paradigms from a variety of disciplines and elaborates on a set of boundary conditions (e.g., relationship life cycle and globalization) that influence the role of the sales force in value creation and appropriation.

In spite of this extensive interest, systematic research regarding the effects of CSR on other stakeholder groups, besides consumers, remains sparse. Based on a field study in a global Fortune 500 consumer packaged goods company, we examine sales force attitudinal and behavioral outcomes of company's partnership with a United Nations (UN) philanthropic organization. Specifically, we seek to examine whether sales force perceptions of CSR motives influence their evaluation of CSR actions. Findings indicate that egoistic-driven motives negatively influence salesperson trust in the company, whereas stakeholder- and values-driven motives positively influence salesperson trust; however, strategic-driven attributions do not have an influence on salesperson trust. The results further reveal the mediating role of trust in the relationship between sales force attributions and outcomes including loyalty intentions and positive word-of-mouth. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Attributions | Behavioral intentions | Corporate social responsibility | Loyalty | Organizational trust | Sales force,111,0,,,,undefined,,8215699600,Nikolaos Panagopoulos,Nikolaos,Panagopoulos,Tenure,Professor,Marketing Faculty,0000-0002-5104-2740,8215699600,Industrial Marketing Management,0019-8501,Top,,,2010-2011

How and when does it affect performance? This study attempts to provide answers to these overlooked questions by developing a comprehensive conceptualization of sales strategy and examining its impact on sales force and firm performance. Sales strategy was operationalized as a multidimensional construct consisting of four dimensions, namely customer segmentation, customer prioritization/targeting, developing relationship objectives/selling models, and use of multiple sales channels. Moreover, by drawing on the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, as well as on industrial organization theory (IOT), the authors test the moderating effects of transformational leadership, customer solution orientation, and demand uncertainty on the sales strategy-performance relationship. Analyses of survey and secondary data from a sample of 170 firms provide evidence that sales strategy is consistently and positively associated with performance while transformational leadership, customer solution orientation, and demand uncertainty were found to exert significant moderating effects on this relationship. The study's findings have important implications. For marketing researchers, they put forward an empirical operationalization of sales strategy and provide evidence regarding the usefulness of the RBV and IOT perspectives for explaining its performance implications. For managers, the findings show that a well-crafted sales strategy pays off and to get the most out of their sales strategy managers should (a) adopt a transformational leadership approach, (b) assess changes in demand, and (c) assess the degree to which their customers are demanding the provision of solutions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The first focuses on the notion of sales force control systems (SFCS) while the second focuses on transformational leadership (TL) behaviors. To date, however, no theoretical or empirical attempt has been made to integrate these two mostly unconnected streams of research in a sales management context. The present study aims to attempt such integration by conceptualizing TL as a mediator of the relationship between behavior-based control (BBC) and key salesperson outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - Responses were gathered via a mail survey from a sample of 128 salespeople working in various industries. Structural equation modeling was employed. Findings - The results provide evidence for the mediating effect of TL on the relationships between BBC and key salesperson outcomes. Moreover, it was found that BBC positively affects TL behaviors, which, in turn, enhance salesperson performance, satisfaction with supervision, and organizational commitment. Research limitations/implications - The present study focused at SFCS as a possible antecedent of TL behaviors. Future researchers should identify other possible antecedents of TL behaviors. Practical implications - With the assumption that TL behaviors enhance salespeople's motivation and performance, chief sales executives should employ a BBC system, as it can facilitate the ability of sales managers to engage in TL behaviors. Originality/value - This paper fills an important void in current leadership research and offers practical guidance to sales managers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Control systems | Sales management | Sales performance | Transformational leadership,37,0,,,,undefined,,8215699600,Nikolaos Panagopoulos,Nikolaos,Panagopoulos,Tenure,Professor,Marketing Faculty,0000-0002-5104-2740,8215699600,European Journal of Marketing,0309-0566,Top,,,2008-2009

Among the various measurement scales, the scale developed by Babakus and his colleagues (Babakus et al. 1996) has gained wide acceptance. However, the BCCS (Babakus and colleagues control system) scale's measurement and operationalization has not been consistent across studies. Based on three different samples, the present study seeks to critically evaluate and cross-validate the measurement properties of the BCCS.

The vast majority of previous studies relies on single-source data and has overlooked the multilevel nature of organizations when modelling relationships of interest. To address these gaps, this study examines the behavioral and psychological effects of sales management practices by applying a multilevel analytic approach to data gathered from two different data sources, sales managers and salespeople, respectively. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Finally, we examined the support for the situational antecedents of experienced mistreatment to compare the relative evidence for each of these dominant theoretical explanations. Results for the tests of the victim precipitation model showed that only victim negative affectivity was consistently related to experienced mistreatment. Examinations of the explanations for the relationships between victim personality and victimization showed relatively weak support for the notion that certain employees are more likely to perceive mistreatment and for the proposition that certain employees are mistreated because they are also more likely to engage in mistreatment. Finally, the situational predictors of mistreatment were all supported, and a test of relative importance revealed that the situational antecedents accounted for more variance in mistreatment than the victim dispositional traits.

The intent of this team selling literature review is to: 1) define team selling, 2) review recent and relevant literature that focuses on team selling both within and outside of the marketing discipline, 3) identify themes evident in the current team selling research, and 4) outline promising areas for future investigations that stem from each research theme.",Sales Teams | Selling Centers | Team Selling | Teams,0,0,,,,undefined,,14525426900,Adam Rapp,Adam,Rapp,Tenure,Professor,Marketing Faculty,,14525426900,Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management,0885-3134,High Quality,,,2022-2023

Extant perspectives offer conflicting advice on which accounts to target and how to price such proposals. The authors investigate how expansion proposals can be strategically targeted and designed to enhance supplier financial outcomes. A novel conceptual framework provides direction for targeted account growth based on three relationship metrics: sales potential, prior profitability, and service level. Two studies with a major industrial supplier assess the effects of relationship expansion proposals contingent on these three metrics. A quasi-experiment in Study 1 reveals that higher sales potential and higher service provision make accounts an ideal target for expansion efforts. However, when a relationship exhibits higher past profitability, expansion proposals can backfire. Study 2 focuses on discounting expansion proposals to incentivize customer response. Results show that the depth of discounting in a proposal can negatively affect sales. The findings contribute to industrial marketing literature by (i) demonstrating positive and negative financial outcomes of customer growth strategies, (ii) showing how these outcomes depend on multiple relationship metrics in ways that align with value capture theory, and (iii) illustrating and explaining ambivalent effects of discounts in expansion proposals.",Growth strategies | Relationship expansion | Targeted discounts | Value capture,0,0,,,,undefined,,14525426900,Adam Rapp,Adam,Rapp,Tenure,Professor,Marketing Faculty,,14525426900,Industrial Marketing Management,0019-8501,Top,,,2022-2023

We explore these ideas using data collected from salespeople in the direct selling industry. The data collected includes 20 exploratory interviews with salesperson-customer dyads, a field study of 153 salespeople and 98 matched customers, and analyses that allow for the presence of non-linear, moderated effects.

One way to do this is by adopting an environmental orientation (EO) and pro-social organizational identity (PSOI). The purpose of this paper is to examine how frontline employees (FLEs) respond to these firm-level values through four outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: Polynomial structural equation modeling with response surface analysis was implemented on FLEs survey data to uncover how different levels of EO and PSOI impact sales performance, word-of-mouth, turnover intent and job satisfaction. Findings: Both firm-level values have a positive and direct effect on all four outcomes. However, each imposes a boundary condition as well. Specifically, salespeople perform better when their firm has a stronger EO, but they are happier in their work, less likely to quit and more likely to spread positive word-of-mouth when PSOI is stronger. Practical implications: The results suggest that perceptions of a firm-level EO or PSOI enhance employee-level outcomes. Signaling to employees that your firm cares about the natural environment and the greater social good positively influences employee outcomes, but optimization of each outcome depends on the strength of those values. Originality/value: This research answers two specific research calls. First, it applies signaling theory to the workplace context, positioning FLEs as the receivers and feedback mechanisms of firm-level signals. Second, using too-much-of-a-good-thing logic, it uncovers boundary conditions imposed by social and environmental constructs on frontline outcomes.",Boundary condition | Employee | Environmental orientation | Frontline service employees | Pro-social organizational identity | Signaling theory | Too-much-of-a-good-thing | Word-of-mouth,10,0,,,,undefined,,14525426900,Adam Rapp,Adam,Rapp,Tenure,Professor,Marketing Faculty,,14525426900,Journal of Services Marketing,0887-6045,High Quality,,,2020-2021

This practice raises questions about how sales managers’ time allocation to managing and selling activities affects sales team performance. Building on qualitative findings, this research first highlights and categorizes activities that are regularly competing for the limited time resources of today’s sales managers. Our qualitative results reveal a prevalence of sales managers taking a “hybrid” approach to managing their sales teams by regularly allocating time toward both managing and selling activities. Through a resource allocation lens, we investigate how the time allocation decisions of these hybrid sales managers influence sales team performance. Our findings underscore the importance of effective time management for sales managers across a core set of leader behaviors, including managing people, managing information (planning and analysis), customer interaction, and administrative tasks. Ultimately, boundary conditions suggest counterintuitive implications of team experience on the value derived from various manager activities. Findings suggest that when managing more (less) experienced teams, managers should focus on spending more time on managing people (customer interaction).",hybrid sales manager | sales experience | sales team performance | time allocation | time management,13,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,14525426900,Adam Rapp,Adam,Rapp,Tenure,Professor,Marketing Faculty,,14525426900,Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management,0885-3134,High Quality,,,2019-2020

Although power and dependence have been carefully examined, the impact of control on relational and transactional exchanges has yet to be explored. Previous research has examined antecedents and outcomes of desire for control. This research examines desire for control in the business-to-business context, specifically the relationship between the supplier and the retailer, where traditionally the buyer (retailer) is more likely to have a higher desire for control in the relationship.

Results from our analysis reveal that salesperson expertise drives retailers' desire for control in these relationships. In addition, while incongruence in perceived-desired control was negatively associated with both satisfaction and objective sales, retailer satisfaction was higher when both desired and perceived control were high. Further, as desired and perceived control over the sales relationship both increase, product sales initially decrease, and then increase, exhibiting a ""U-shaped"" effect. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed. These include adaptive sales training to identify misalignment between desired and perceived control, optimization of cocreation strategies, incorporation of interorganizational relational constructs, exploration of triadic social network configurations, examination of unmet expectations, and the implications of assimilation-contrast theory.",Desired control | Perceived control | Response surface modeling | Sales outcomes | Social capital theory,22,0,,,,undefined,,14525426900,Adam Rapp,Adam,Rapp,Tenure,Professor,Marketing Faculty,,14525426900,Journal of Applied Psychology,0021-9010,Elite,,,2014-2015

Their interaction is also significant, which suggests that a firm that it is both environmentally oriented and innovative is most likely to develop an eco-capability.

However, prior work in the area has paid little attention to how CSR initiatives should be implemented inside the organization. Against this backdrop, this study examines the impact of CSR initiatives on an important stakeholder group-employees. We build and test a comprehensive multilevel framework that focuses on whether employees derive job satisfaction from CSR programs. The proposed model predicts that a manager's charismatic leadership influences employees' interpretations about the motives underlying their companies' engagement in CSR initiatives (intrinsic and extrinsic CSR-induced attributions) which, in turn, influence employee job satisfaction. Hierarchical linear modeling of data from 47 organizational units comprising 438 employees from three world-leading manufacturing organizations shows that when employees think that their manager possesses charismatic leadership qualities, they tend to attribute the organization's motives for engaging in CSR activities to intrinsic values, which, in turn, are positively associated with job satisfaction. Also, the extent to which managers are perceived as charismatic leaders relates positively to job satisfaction. Interestingly, CSR-induced extrinsic attributions are neither explained by charismatic leadership nor do they predict job satisfaction.

Using the concept of social capital as a theoretical foundation and multilevel data collected at three time points from 686 customer-salesperson dyads, the authors empirically test a conceptual framework that proposes both antecedents and consequences of CI sharing between customer and salesperson. The results of the study demonstrate that CI sharing by customers is a function of salesperson customer orientation, customer-centric extra-role behaviors, and relationship quality. CI sharing translates into increased perceived value, share-of-wallet, and profit margins when the salesperson utilizes the information to position and differentiate his or her product; however this occurs only when the salesperson has strong adaptive selling skills. Surprisingly, CI negatively influences these outcomes among low-adaptive salespeople, indicating that CI can actually work to a firm's disadvantage if the salesperson is not equipped to respond to it. These findings suggest that CI must be examined differently than general market knowledge and that firms may leverage CI to their tactical advantage at the salesperson-customer interface if managed effectively. © 2012 Academy of Marketing Science.",Adaptive selling | Competitive intelligence | Customer orientation | Information use | Marketing intelligence | Multilevel modeling | Perceived value | Salespeople | Social capital,129,0,,,,undefined,,14525426900,Adam Rapp,Adam,Rapp,Tenure,Professor,Marketing Faculty,,14525426900,Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,0092-0703,Elite,,,2012-2013

From initial research reviewing sales force laptop usage to more recent studies investigating the effects of advanced customer relationship management applications, much insight has been garnered regarding technology and sales. However, much of this investigation has occurred in business-to-business environments, leaving what we believe to be a considerable gap in knowledge on technology in business-to-consumer settings. In this paper, we briefly review some areas of research that we believe have seen abundant investigation and offer other fruitful avenues for research.

Such controls may be especially tempting given the findings that favorable salesperson product perceptions actually yield less effort on the new product, and behavior-based controls can offset this tendency. However, using longitudinal data from a sample of 226 salespeople, along with external ratings from customers and archival measures of effort and sales performance, the authors demonstrate that such a strategy is shortsighted. Behavior-based controls constrain a salesperson's ability to appropriately allocate effort across his or her customer base, negatively affecting customer product perceptions and, ultimately, new product sales. In contrast, outcome-based control systems enable salespeople to work smarter, and their corresponding effort on behalf of the new product has a more positive effect on customer product perceptions and new product sales. © 2010, American Marketing Association.",Control systems | New products | Product perceptions | Sales management | Salesperson effort,130,0,,,,undefined,,14525426900,Adam Rapp,Adam,Rapp,Tenure,Professor,Marketing Faculty,,14525426900,Journal of Marketing Research,0022-2437,Elite,,,2009-2010

Design/methodology/approach: Empirical support was derived from salesperson survey data combined with customer-reported satisfaction ratings. All 254 sales representatives of the women's health care division of a pharmaceutical company were surveyed for this research study. Findings: The results suggest that managers can benefit by extending salesforce training to address not only technical knowledge but also communication skills. Providing technology with the potential to increase customer satisfaction through improved information communication would be beneficial as well. Practical implications: The research suggests that managers should invest resources not only in providing salespeople with technical knowledge, but also in training them in effective communication skills. Further, the benefit has been shown, in terms of customer satisfaction, of providing technology to support communication between salespeople and customers. Originality/value: The study uses the relationship marketing approach to explore the critical role of information communication construct in a buyer- seller exchange process.

While outsourcing was once limited to peripheral firm activities such as advertising, firms are expanding the types of functions they outsource. For instance, many firms have begun to outsource their sales force, or at a minimum, have begun to consider 'renting' a sales force rather than 'owning' their own sales force. Being a recent trend, very little is known about what prompts firms to outsource their sales forces, nor the consequences of doing so. As such, this research explores the factors associated with determining whether a firm should outsource their sales force as well as the value to be had by engaging in such a decision. Most importantly, we offer that beyond the standard cost-based analysis, there are numerous issues that deserve consideration and examination before a firm elects to outsource its sales force. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Hypotheses are tested using survey data from a sample of 108 salespeople in a business-to-business context and archival sales performance information. Moderated regression analysis results indicate that the use of sales force automation tools only enhances salesperson efficiency and effectiveness under conditions of adequate user support and training.

The study also seeks to explore how the environmental consciousness relates with participation motives in an urban and rural race setting. Design/methodology/approach: Participants from urban and rural races were surveyed to explore the relationships between their environmental consciousness, their race selection type and the sport tourism motivational profile for the runners in each of these race locations. Findings: A logistic regression was statistically significant in predicting urban vs rural race choice, correctly classifying 84 percent of cases. Increases in motivational responses relating to self-enrichment, social needs, catharsis and aggression were all associated with an increased likelihood in choosing an urban race. Conversely, motivational constructs related to tourism (e.g. destination attributes) were particularly effective in classifying rural race participants. Subsequent tests revealed significant differences in five of the nine race motives between runners based on their low, medium and high levels of environmental consciousness. Research limitations/implications: Implications from this study serve to extend the literature on sport and tourism sustainability by understanding the environmental paradigm and sport tourism motives of distance runners in urban and rural race destinations. Practical implications: This study also serves event organizers from a practical standpoint by offering suggestions to market and execute events in line with participants’ underlying motives which were found to be different in an urban vs rural setting. Originality/value: In a highly competitive event space like road races, effective differentiation and marketing are paramount to attracting participants. This study advances the research in this area by exploring the role that runners’ concern for the environment plays in their destination and event choice, as well as the differences that may exist in the sport tourism motivational profile for runners at an urban vs rural race destination.",Destination | Environmental paradigm | Sport tourism,10,0,,,,undefined,,57206972826,Melissa Davies,Melissa,Davies,Tenure,Assistant Professor,Sports Administration Faculty,,57206972826,International Journal of Event and Festival Management,1758-2954,High Quality,,,2018-2019

Consequently, we highlight racial/ethnic identities, racial attitudes, and political identities as predictors of these public opinions. Data for our analyses come from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults who were surveyed just prior to the 2016 presidential election. Descriptive results suggest that well over half of U.S. adults opposed having the NCAA pay college athletes; also, about two-thirds of adults viewed athlete protests during the national anthem as unacceptable. Regression results reveal that Black and Latinx adults were more supportive of paying college athletes and athlete protests during the national anthem than White adults. Other people of color were also more likely than White adults to support paying college athletes. Racial attitudes such as a lack of recognition of racial/ethnic inequalities in education and support for Black Lives Matter also shaped public opinions about these issues in expected ways. Finally, we find that political identities were linked to public opinions about these issues even after accounting for racial/ethnic identities and racial attitudes. Overall, this study documents public opinions about these prominent sports-related issues just prior to the 2016 election of a President who particularly racialized and politicized sports issues. Even then, these sports-related issues had been similarly filtered through both a White racial frame that encourages colorblind racism and a counter frame that promotes antiracist activism. Altogether, the present study offers further evidence of how sports provide cultural terrain for individuals to enact and negotiate racialized and politicized views of sports and society and illustrates how these processes were reflected in public opinions in 2016.",College Sport | Professional Sport | Protest | Public Opinion | Race/ethnicity,8,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,,36769332900,B.

From a sporting perspective, FS is often criticized because such online activities may be at the expense of physical activities. Otherwise, gamification can ultimately lead to economic advantages for sport leagues. To further empirically analyse this supposed juxtaposition, an empirical study is presented. Design/methodology/approach: In the empirical study, participation and non-participation in a sport league-related FS league are analysed and the study uses a divided sample (N = 319) for a one-factor Welch-ANOVA. FS effects on sport practice (engaging in doing sport) and usage (engaging with sport) of FS players as well as on gaining and retaining fans are investigated. Findings: Results demonstrate that participating in gamified FS experiences increases sport usage while not harming general sport practice. Furthermore, FS participation increases consumption capital as well as sport fans' loyalty and word of mouth (WOM) towards the league brand. Building on the results, league brands should foster gamified FS applications to retain their fan base and acquire new fans. Originality/value: The authors’ theoretical contribution indicates the importance of FS as a gamified application and essential marketing tool for professional sport leagues. By introducing the terms sport practice and usage, the authors bridge the traditional logic of sport consumption with innovative approaches around engagement in and with sports. The results refute the prejudice that FS leads to less physical activity due to time substitution or displacement.",Consumption capital | Fantasy sports | Loyalty | Sport practice | Sport usage | Word of mouth,1,0,,,,undefined,,36769332900,B.

This study further explored factors that influence perceptions of the disadvantages and advantages of both sport delivery systems. Fifty-one athletes participated in the quantitative study with nine athletes taking part in follow up qualitative interviews. The results demonstrate that European athletes believe media coverage, sport-environment, and facilities are the biggest advantages of the U.S. educationally based sports delivery system, while coaches, talent development, and levels of competition are the advantages of the European sports system. Results of this study can be used to enhance and/or change current sport development models to provide better access to elite development, mass participation, and educational opportunities in different worldwide sports development systems.

Sport, due to its global nature, has become an international business, leading to sport management programs at postsecondary institutions growing in number and the marketing of such programs becoming a key success factor. In an increasingly competitive educational environment, both effective curriculum offerings and innovative marketing, including branding, are important for a successful sport management program. This article shares a case study of innovative marketing-the co-branding through a double degree program between two longstanding sport management programs, one in North America (Ohio University, United States) and one in Europe (University of Bayreuth, Germany). This program is designed to enhance international education, as well as global internship and job-placement opportunities. The details of the double degree program within the background of co-branding are presented as a pedagogical framework for international education. Data from a survey of industry professionals are analyzed to demonstrate the need for such an international double degree program.

However, in the context of sport, this research is deficient. We found no published literature investigating athletic trainers (ATs') attitudes toward lesbian, gay, and bisexual student-athletes (LGB). Objective: To determine heterosexual ATs' attitudes toward LGB student-athletes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Design: Cross-sectional study Setting: E-mailed survey. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 964 ATs employed at member institutions. Main Outcome Measure(s): We measured attitudes using the Attitudes Toward Lesbian, Gay Men, and Bisexuals (ATLGB) Scale. To determine the extent to which sex, religion, and whether having an LGB friend or family member had an effect on ATs' attitudes, we performed analysis of variance. To establish the effect of age on ATs' attitudes, we calculated a Pearson correlation. We used an independent t test to identify differences between ATs who reported working with LGB student-athletes and ATs who did not. Results: With ATLGB score as the dependent factor, a main effect was noted for sex, religion, and having an LGB friend or family member (P < .01 for all comparisons). Age and total score were related (P < .01). A difference was seen in the ATLGB scores between ATs who were aware of LGB student- athletes on their teams and ATs who were not (P < .001). Conclusions: Many ATs hold positive attitudes toward LGB student-athletes, especially females, those who have an LGB friend or family member, and those who are aware of LGB student-athletes. Still, it is important to provide an open environment in the athletic training room for all student-athletes. © by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.",Athletic training | Diversity | Sexual orientation,26,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,,36769332900,B.
